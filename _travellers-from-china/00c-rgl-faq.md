## **Application Process for Residents in China**

### **Application**

#### 1. Who is eligible to apply to travel to Singapore under the fast lane?

Residents in China who need to make essential business or official travel between Singapore and the six fast lane regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang).

#### 2. I am a Singapore Citizen / Singapore Permanent Resident / Singapore Long-Term Pass holder* who is resident in China. Am I eligible to apply for the fast lane?

Yes. All residents in China who need to make short-term essential business or official travel between Singapore and the six fast lane regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang) are eligible to apply for the fast lane.

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">* <em>Long-Term Pass holders who are eligible to apply for fast lane travel include holders of MOM-issued work passes (e.g. Employment Pass, EntrePass, Personalised Employment Pass, S Pass, Work Permit, Dependant’s Pass) and holders of the ICA-issued Long-Term Visit Pass.</em></p>

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;"><em>Long-Term Pass holders returning to Singapore after a visit to China via the fast lane should identify themselves as fast lane travellers during pre-departure airline checks in China and to ICA at Singapore immigration by presenting the Letter of Invitation issued by the Chinese provincial/municipal government of the fast lane region.</em></p>

#### 3. How do residents in China apply to travel to Singapore under the fast lane? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a visa? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit?

Residents in China seeking to travel to Singapore for essential business or official travel via the fast lane must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can self-sponsor and file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly, or through a sponsoring government agency.<sup>1</sup> The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open from 20 to 5 working days before the day of the traveller’s planned departure.

In the initial launch which commenced on 8 June 2020, travellers sponsored by government agencies may submit applications for a SafeTravel Pass through their respective sponsoring government agencies. Direct applications by companies will be accepted in a later phase, to be announced.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the applicant and the sponsoring company / government agency by email within 3 working days.

With this letter, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder will proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels (Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, local contact or companies) at least 4 working days before departure. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>. Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for fast lane travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved applicant will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the SG Arrival Card, within three days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

The sponsoring company or government agency should log onto the SafeTravel Pass portal one to two days before the traveller’s departure to submit the traveller’s negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result and controlled itinerary in Singapore. The traveller is required to produce a valid SafeTravel Pass, a negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result, a return air ticket, and a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders) for pre-boarding checks at the airlines check-in counter and immigration counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding.

#### 4.	What is a SafeTravel Pass?

A SafeTravel Pass allows residents in China to seek entry into Singapore under the fast lane. It will be valid for one single entry into Singapore anytime within the stipulated week (0000hrs Monday to 2359hrs Sunday). Travellers must enter Singapore within this stipulated week, and can stay in Singapore for the duration of their Visit Pass issued to them at the immigration checkpoint in Singapore. For example, if the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass is valid from 6 to 12 July 2020, he/she must seek entry into Singapore within this period, and can stay for the duration of the Visit Pass issued to him/her at the checkpoint.

SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass.

#### 5.	Can tourists apply for SafeTravel Passes?

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists.

#### 6.	Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner?

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

#### 7.	Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

No payment is required.

#### 8.	Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can apply for a SafeTravel Pass. Every entry to Singapore requires a new SafeTravel Pass application.

If the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass has expired, he/she should submit a new application.

#### 9. What visa will I be eligible for under the fast lane, and what is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore?

Every application for a visa, including the type of visa granted, will be considered on its own merits and subject to approval. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/ she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>. Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for fast lane travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

Travellers who are granted entry into Singapore are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### 10. How can I further extend my Visit Pass / stay when I am in Singapore, if necessary?

All applications for extension of Visit Pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-Service (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend>) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the Visit Pass to avoid overstaying. Extension of Visit Pass will not be accepted over the counter. Each application is considered on its own merits.

#### 11. Can I use the fast lane to come to Singapore for long-term work?

The fast lane is only for short-term essential business and official travel, and not for long-term work. Travellers seeking to enter Singapore for long-term work may wish to visit <https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits> for more information on a separate scheme.

#### 12. Can I use the fast lane to come to Singapore for long-term study?

The fast lane is only for short-term essential business and official travel, and not for long-term study.

#### 13.Can I use the fast lane to transit through Singapore?

### **Testing Arrangements**

#### 14. What COVID-19 tests will I be subject to upon arrival in Singapore? Will I be subject to a serology test in Singapore?

The traveller will undergo a PCR test upon arrival at Changi Airport or Seletar Airport in Singapore. The traveller does not need to undergo a serology test in Singapore in the first instance. The traveller should expect to pay around S$300 (inclusive of GST) for the post-arrival test.

#### 15. What if I test positive for COVID-19 in Singapore?

If tested positive for COVID-19, short-term pass holders will be accorded the necessary medical treatment at his/her cost.

Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders will not be required to pay for their inpatient medical bills at public hospitals in Singapore should they be suspected of or test positive for COVID-19, for as long as the Singapore Government is paying COVID-19 patient bills for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders, except for those who leave Singapore from 27 March 2020 onwards in disregard of the prevailing travel advisories, and have onset of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 within 14 days of return to Singapore.*

Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders who leave Singapore under the fast lane arrangement and comply with fast lane conditions are not travelling in disregard of travel advisories. They will not be required to pay for their medical bills at public hospitals in Singapore should they test positive for COVID-19 after their return to Singapore.

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;"><em>* Specifically, such patients will be charged at the unsubsidised rates at the public hospitals for any inpatient treatment relating to COVID-19. In addition, Singapore residents will not be able to claim from MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plans for these treatments at the public and private hospitals.</em></p>

### **Pre-Departure Measures in China**

#### 16. What health measures must I take in China before departing for Singapore?

Travellers must remain in any of the sending fast lane regions (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang) for seven days prior to departure for Singapore. They must monitor their health status before departure from the fast lane regions in China, undergo a pre-departure PCR test in China at least once within 48 hours before departure, and obtain a certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19 from the medical institutions designated by the relevant provincial/municipal government in China.

#### 17. What documentation do I need to present to the airline staff at check-in before I will be allowed to board a flight from China to Singapore?

The traveller is required to produce the following documents for pre-boarding checks:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>A valid SafeTravel Pass approval letter (the date of entry into Singapore must fall within the period of entry stated in the letter);</li>
  <li>A valid visa to enter Singapore (for visa-required passport holders who are short-term visitors to Singapore);</li>
  <li>A valid certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure for Singapore (the certificate must be from the medical institutions designated by the relevant provincial/municipal government in China); and</li>
  <li>A return air ticket or proof of other transportation arrangements to depart Singapore.</li>
</ol>

Otherwise, the traveller may be refused boarding.

### **Health Measures in Singapore**

#### 18. What health measures will I will be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore?

Fast lane travellers from China must take a PCR test after arrival in Singapore, and remain isolated in a declared self-sourced accommodation (non-residential address only) for one to two days until their test results are released. Transportation from the airport to the declared accommodation will have to be provided by the host company or government agency subject to prevailing health measures<sup>2</sup>. Travellers will bear the costs of the post-arrival PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for the first 14 days of the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport<sup>3</sup>.

Travellers to Singapore must use the TraceTogether app, take their temperature twice daily, report their health status to the host company or government agency, and adhere to prevailing public health requirements for the duration of their stay in Singapore.

#### 19. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above. More information on the app can be found at <https://tracetogether.gov.sg>.


### **Returning to China**

#### 20. Do I need to be tested again in Singapore before I return to China? Do I need to be quarantined or be tested again upon return to China?

Fast lane returnees to China currently do not need to be tested again in Singapore before returning to China.

Upon their arrival back in China, they must adhere to the prevailing COVID-19 prevention and control measures of the Chinese government. This may include a 14-day quarantine or COVID-19 tests at the returnee’s cost, as required by most provinces/municipalities for international arrivals into China.

As the specific requirements may vary amongst provinces/municipalities, the returnee should verify the latest requirements with the relevant provincial/municipal authorities.

Residents in Singapore (i.e., Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, Long-Term Pass holders) who need to make essential business or official travel between Singapore and the six fast lane regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Zhejiang).

The relevant Chinese government authorities will assess each application on a case-by-case basis.

#### 2.	How do Singapore residents apply to travel to China under the fast lane?

Residents in Singapore seeking to travel to China for essential business or official travel via the fast lane must be sponsored by either a company or a government agency in China, which will file an application on behalf of the applicant with the local provincial/municipal authorities.  As the application process and documents required for each province/municipality may vary, the local host company or government agency should check with the relevant local provincial/municipal authorities for more details. A list of these local authorities is at **<a href="#annexa">ANNEX A</a>**.

If the application is approved, a Letter of Invitation specifically for essential business or official travel under the fast lane will be issued to the applicant. The approved applicant will thereafter submit a visa application and health declaration to the PRC Embassy in Singapore, which will issue the applicant a visa. The requirement to obtain a visa also applies to Singaporeans visiting China for less than 15 days, as the 15-day visa free facility for Singaporeans travelling to China remains suspended by the PRC government until further notice. For more details on visa application, please contact the PRC Embassy in Singapore.

The traveller should work with his/her local host company or government agency to verify that he/she has fulfilled the fast lane requirements of the provincial/municipal authorities prior to departure for China. Besides taking a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test and obtaining a negative test result within 48 hours before departure, this may also include other requirements such as keeping the local authorities informed of the traveller’s flight details.

#### 3. What visas will I be eligible for under the fast lane, and what is the visa duration in China?

The duration and type of the visas issued by China will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the Chinese authorities.

#### 6.	Where in China may I travel to? What are the approvals which I will need to obtain to do so?

The fast lane is for travel between Singapore and the six fast lane regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Zhejiang).

A traveller from Singapore who needs to travel between adjacent fast lane regions in China (e.g., from Shanghai to Jiangsu, or Shanghai to Zhejiang, etc.) within the first 14 days upon arrival, shall, through the host company or government agency, acquire in advance the approval (i.e., Letter of Invitation) from the relevant provincial/municipal authorities of the next destination.

The traveller is only allowed to use the private transport designated by his/her host company or government agency to travel to other fast lane regions. Travel via plane, rail, inter-city buses or other means of public transportation is not allowed.

After the first 14 days, inter-provincial/municipal travel for the non-fast lane regions within China will be allowed for a fast lane traveller from Singapore, as long as he/she adheres to the same domestic travel restrictions imposed on residents in China to move between those provinces/municipalities concerned.

As some provinces/municipalities may require additional COVID-19 test(s) before the traveller is allowed to embark on inter-provincial/municipal travel, the traveller’s local host company or government agency should check with the relevant local provincial/municipality authorities if there are any such requirements.

#### 7.	Who can I contact for more information on the arrangements in China, e.g., accommodation and transport?

The traveller may contact his/her host company or government agency in China to make the necessary arrangements in China.

A fast lane traveller departing for China can make an appointment in advance at certain clinics in Singapore for a pre-departure test at the traveller’s cost. The traveller must take the test within 48 hours before departure, and obtain a health certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19.

The list of clinics that can perform pre-departure COVID-19 tests isand details on the procedure to book an appointment are at **<a href="#annexb">ANNEX B</a>**. Testing for fast lane arrangements can only be carried out at these clinics at the moment. An eligible fast lane traveller can contact the clinic directly for testing.

The traveller will need to adhere to the clinic’s cut-off timings for the pre-departure tests to ensure that he/she is able to obtain the test results in time to be allowed to check-in for his/her flight.

The traveller must also obtain a letter from the PRC Embassy in Singapore which confirms that he/she has been granted approval by the relevant authorities in China to travel to China under the Singapore-China Fast Lane. This letter will be used as an indication of the traveller’s eligibility to take a pre-departure COVID-19 test. This letter must be presented at the clinic before the test can be administered.

The traveller should expect to pay up to S$200 (inclusive of GST) for the pre-departure test. This is not payable by MediSave, MediShield Life and Integrated Shield Plans.

#### 9.	What tests will I be subject to upon arrival in China? Will I be subject to a serology test in China?

A fast lane traveller to China will be subject to one PCR test and one serology test upon arrival.<sup>1</sup>

#### 10. What if I test positive for COVID-19 in China?

If tested positive for COVID-19 in China, the traveller will be accorded the necessary medical treatment by the local government at his/her cost.

#### 11. I have completely recovered from COVID-19, but may still test positive on the post-arrival serology test in China. May I still travel to China?

The Chinese authorities require a traveller to test negative for both the post-arrival PCR test and serology test before the traveller can proceed with his/her travel plans in China.

#### 12. Do I have to take another PCR test in China before I return to Singapore?

Travellers do not have to take another PCR test in China before returning to Singapore.

### **Pre-Departure in Singapore**

#### 13. What documentation do I need to present to the airline staff at check-in before I will be allowed to board a flight from Singapore to China?

Minimally, a traveller should have on hand his/her negative COVID-19 PCR test result, a valid visa and a Letter of Invitation issued by the Chinese provincial/municipal authorities of Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin or Zhejiang specifically for essential business or official travel under the fast lane.

As the specific requirements may vary amongst provinces/municipalities, the traveller should verify the latest requirements with his/her local host company or government agency.

### **Health Measures in China**

#### 14. Do I need to be quarantined upon arrival in China?

After undergoing a PCR test and serology test upon arrival, the traveller must remain in a centralised quarantine area designated by the local provincial/municipal government for one to two days until the test results are released. The traveller has to bear the costs of the post-arrival tests and the one to two days’ stay in the designated location.

If the traveller tests negative for both COVID-19 tests, the host company or government agency will transport the traveller directly from the above-mentioned location designated by the local provincial/municipal government to the workplace or residence.

#### 15. What other health measures will I be subject to in China? What would qualify as a “controlled itinerary” in China?

The traveller must follow local COVID-19 prevention and control measures for the duration of his/her stay in China, including downloading the local health QR code used in the province/municipality.

The host company or government agency will supervise the itinerary of and provide private transport for the traveller for the first 14 days upon his/her arrival in China.

The traveller can only commute between his/her residence and the workplace via a dedicated car and driver (i.e., no public transport allowed).

While a traveller no longer needs to adhere to a controlled itinerary after the first 14 days, he/she must still follow local COVID-19 prevention and control measures for the duration of his/her stay in China. As some provinces/municipalities may require the traveller to undergo additional COVID-19 test(s) before being allowed to move beyond a controlled itinerary after the first 14 days, your local host company or government agency should verify the latest requirements with the relevant local provincial/municipality authorities.

### **Returning to Singapore**

#### 16. What health measures will I be subject to upon returning to Singapore after my fast lane travel?

From 17 June 2020, 2359 hours, all returnees to Singapore from China will be issued with a 14-day Stay-Home -Notice (SHN) upon entry into Singapore.* They will also be required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test before the end of their SHN.

Returnees who are Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents may serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence. Returnees who are Long-Term Pass holders may serve their 14-day SHN at a place of residence that they or their family members own or are sole tenants of; or in suitable accommodations such as a hotel, at their own cost.

All persons under SHN must remain in their place of residence at all times. They will be subject to close monitoring of their whereabouts, through electronic monitoring as well as physical spot-checks. Strict enforcement action will be taken against those who breach the requirements of the SHN.

##### 17.	Do I have to pay for my COVID-19 medical bills if I am found to have COVID-19 upon return from China?

Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders who travel under the fast lane arrangement and comply with the terms of the fast lane arrangement will not be required to pay for their medical bills at public hospitals should they test positive for COVID-19 upon return from China, for as long as the Singapore Government is paying COVID-19 patient bills for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders.

Please refer to the **Schedule for the “Latest Cut-off Test Timing” and book your test slot within the indicated timing**. This is to ensure that you meet the fast lane requirements.

If you do not make a prior appointment, please note that:

  <li>There is no guarantee that there will be a test slot for you; and</li>
  <li>You may not get your results in time for your flight to qualify for fast lane arrangements.</li>
</ol>

Travellers who miss the cut-off test timing will not be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.

##### 5. What details will I need to book an appointment for the PCR test?

Please have the following information on hand when making an appointment for your test:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

##### Testing

##### 7. What if I miss my test timing? What if I take my test after the Cut-off Test Timing?

Travellers who miss the Cut-off Test Timing will not be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.

Please make arrangements early for your test slot so that you can qualify for the fast lane arrangements.

##### 8. What happens if the clinic assesses that I am unable to receive the PCR test for unforeseen circumstances?

If you are unable to receive the test, you may wish to reschedule your flight, if you still wish to tap on the fast lane arrangement.

##### Test Results

##### 9. When can I expect to get my PCR test results?

You will receive your PCR test results and memo at least three hours before your flight.

The clinic will email the results to your email address. You will need to print and bring the memo overseas yourself.
