## **Application Process for Residents in Brunei**

### **Application**

#### 1. Who is eligible to apply to travel to Singapore under the RGL?

Persons of all nationalities who are legal residents in Brunei, who need to make single-entry, <u>short-term</u> essential travel for business and official purposes, between Singapore and Brunei.

#### 2. I am a Singapore Citizen / Singapore Permanent Resident / Singapore Long-Term Pass holder* who is resident in Brunei. Am I eligible to apply for the RGL?

Yes. All residents in Brunei who need to make <u>short-term</u> essential business or official travel between Singapore and Brunei are eligible to apply for the RGL.

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;"><em>Singapore Long-Term Pass holders who are eligible to apply for RGL travel include holders of MOM-issued work passes (e.g. Employment Pass, EntrePass, Personalised Employment Pass, S Pass, Work Permit, Dependent’s Pass) and holders of the ICA-issued Long-Term Visit Pass.</em></p>

#### 3. What is a SafeTravel Pass?

A SafeTravel Pass allows residents in Brunei to seek entry into Singapore under the RGL. It will be valid for one single entry into Singapore anytime within the stipulated week (0000hrs Monday to 2359hrs Sunday). Travellers must enter Singapore within this stipulated week, and can stay in Singapore for the duration of their Visit Pass issued to them in Singapore. For example, if the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass is valid from 7 to 14 September 2020, he/she must seek entry into Singapore within this period, and can stay for the duration of the Visit Pass issued to him/her at the checkpoint.

SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass.

#### 4. Do Bruneian citizens and residents still need to apply to exit the country?

Yes, Brunei citizens and residents travelling to Singapore under the RGL will still need to apply for Exit Travel via Brunei’s PMO. Information on the application can be found on <http://www.pmo.gov.bn/travelportal/Home.aspx>.

#### 5. How do residents in Brunei apply for a SafeTravel Pass to travel to Singapore under the RGL? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a SafeTravel Pass? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit?

Residents in Brunei seeking to travel to Singapore for short-term essential business or official travel via the RGL must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly, or through a sponsoring government agency.<sup>1</sup> Host companies submitting applications for a SafeTravel Pass directly can do so at <https://go.gov.sg/rglapp>.

When applying for the SafeTravel Pass, Proof of Residency in Brunei is required. Bruneian Citizens should present a copy of their passport or their yellow ID card for submission. Non-Bruneian Citizens who are resident in Brunei should present a copy of their Bruneian long-term pass ID for submission. Accepted Brunei ID cards include (a) purple ID cards issued to Permanent Residents who are holders of foreign passports and Certificates of Identity, and (b) green ID cards issued to foreigners residing more than 3 months (e.g. holder of employment pass, dependent pass, student pass and visit pass).

The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open 20 working days (excluding the date of application and date of entry) before the day of the traveller’s planned departure. The processing of the application can take up to 7 working days. Applications submitted less than 7 working days from planned departure will not be accepted. You are encouraged to apply for the SafeTravel Pass as early as possible, factoring in the time necessary for the processing of the SafeTravel Pass application, visa application (if needed) and taking a pre-departure COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test before departure for Singapore.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the applicant and the sponsoring company / government agency by email. With this letter, an approved traveller who is a visa-required passport holder will proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels (Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, local contact or companies) at least 4 working days before departure. If the approved traveller already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The traveller can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>. 

Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Bruneian citizens) will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved traveller will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the SG Arrival Card (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/>), within 3 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

Within 72 hours prior to the arrival in Singapore, the sponsoring company or government agency should submit the traveller’s negative COVID-19 PCR test result and controlled itinerary in Singapore at <https://go.gov.sg/rglsuppdocs>.

The traveller is required to produce a valid SafeTravel Pass, a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders), a return air ticket and a negative COVID-19 PCR test result obtained within 72 hours before departure for pre-boarding checks at the airlines’ check-in counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding.

#### 6. Can tourists apply for SafeTravel Passes?

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists.

Foreigners who are short-term travellers travelling from Brunei Darussalam may also seek entry into Singapore by applying for an Air Travel Pass at <https://go.gov.sg/atpsg>. Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders are not required to apply for an Air Travel Pass to travel to Singapore from Brunei Darussalam. However, Singapore Long-Term Pass holders will still have to seek entry approval from the relevant Singapore Government agencies before travelling to Singapore.

#### 7. Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner?

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

#### 8. Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

No payment is required.

#### 9. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can apply for a SafeTravel Pass. Every entry to Singapore requires a new SafeTravel Pass application.

If the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass has expired, he/she should submit a new application.

One traveller can only hold one valid SafeTravel Pass **for a single entry into Singapore** at any point in time. Please refrain from submitting multiple SafeTravel Pass applications or submitting new applications when you already have a valid SafeTravel Pass on hand. Duplicate applications will be rejected.

#### 10. What visa will I be eligible for under the RGL, and what is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore? 

Every application for a visa, including the type of visa granted, will be considered on its own merits and subject to approval. If the approved traveller already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/ she need not apply for a new visa. The traveller can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>.

Those who did not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Bruneian citizens) will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

Travellers who are granted entry into Singapore are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### 11. How can I further extend my Visit Pass / stay when I am in Singapore, if necessary? 

All applications for extension of Visit Pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-Service (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend>) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the Visit Pass to avoid overstaying. Extension of Visit Pass will not be accepted over the counter. Each application is considered on its own merits.

#### 12. Why was my application rejected and what can I do?

SafeTravel Pass applications may be rejected for reasons, including the following:
- **The quota for the week of entry that the application was submitted was fully utilised.** In this situation, you may consider submitting an application for a SafeTravel Pass for a different week of entry.
- **Application exceeds permissible window, i.e. not within 20 to 7 working days prior to departure.** In this situation, please ensure that you submit the application 20 working days prior to the date of entry into Singapore at the earliest, and 7 working days before the date of entry into Singapore at the latest.
- **Inadequate information provided.**

#### 13. I have submitted the necessary supporting documents prior to my departure from Brunei to Singapore. Why did I receive a notification that the submission was unsuccessful?

You might have submitted the supporting documents earlier than the 72-hour window before the declared date of departure from Brunei. You should submit the supporting documents only after receiving the results of the COVID-19 PCR test which has to be taken within <u>72 hours</u> prior to departure from Brunei. Please resubmit the necessary documents within the stipulated window prior to departure.

Do also ensure that the supporting documents submitted are in the correct format (pdf., jpeg.).

#### 14. Can I use the RGL to come to Singapore for long-term work?

The RGL is only for short-term essential business and official travel, and not for long-term work. Travellers seeking to enter Singapore for long-term work may wish to visit <https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits> for more information on a separate scheme.

#### 15. Can I use the RGL to come to Singapore for long-term study?

The RGL is only for short-term essential business and official travel, and not for long-term study. Travellers seeking to enter Singapore for study may wish to visit <https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/entry-approval-required-for-all-long-term-pass-holders> for more information.

#### 16. Can I use the RGL to transit through Singapore?

The RGL is only for short-term essential business and official travel between Singapore and Brunei, and not for transit through Singapore.

### **Pre-Departure Measures in Brunei**

#### 17. What health measures must I take in Brunei before departing for Singapore?

Travellers must remain in Brunei and have not travelled out of the country for at least 14 days prior to departure for Singapore. They must monitor their health status before departure from Brunei, undergo a pre-departure PCR test in Brunei at least once within 72 hours before departure, and obtain a certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19 issued by the following authorised health centres designated by the Government of Brunei:
- Sports Complex Swab Centre RIPAS Hospital

- A valid SafeTravel Pass approval letter (the date of entry into Singapore must fall within the period of entry stated in the letter);
- A valid visa to enter Singapore (for visa-required passport holders who are short-term visitors to Singapore);
- A valid certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure for Singapore (the certificate must be issued by an authorised health centre designated by the Government of Brunei); and
- A return air ticket or proof of other transportation arrangements to depart Singapore.

### **Testing Arrangements Upon Arrival in Singapore**

#### 19. What COVID-19 tests will I be subject to upon arrival in Singapore? Where will the COVID-19 PCR test be administered? What are the payment modes accepted for the COVID-19 PCR test?

Travellers coming in on the RGL will be directed to take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at Changi Airport or Seletar Airport in Singapore. The traveller must take the COVID-19 PCR test at the assigned swabbing station within the airport. Please approach the airport ground staff upon arrival for assistance.

Travellers are encouraged to pre-register and pre-pay for the COVID-19 PCR test prior to entry into Singapore. Pre-registration and pre-payment can be made on the online portal at <https://safetravel.changiairport.com>. Travellers should expect to pay around S$300 (inclusive of GST) for the test upon arrival at the airport.

#### 20. What if I test positive for COVID-19 in Singapore?

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will be given medical treatment accordingly. Travellers will be responsible for charges for COVID-19 treatment if symptoms develop within 14 days of arrival.

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who travelled on permitted travel arrangements may access Government subsidies and MediShield Life/Integrated Shield Plan to help pay for their bills. Long-Term Pass Holders who travelled on permitted travel arrangements may tap on their usual financing arrangements, such as foreign worker insurance. Travellers should furnish the relevant supporting documents to indicate their status as an RGL traveller.

Note that all Short-Term Pass Holders will be accorded the necessary medical treatment at their cost. Travellers are encouraged to take up health insurance while travelling.

### **Health Measures in Singapore**

#### 21. What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore?

RGL travellers from Brunei must take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore, and remain isolated in a declared self-sourced accommodation (non-residential address only) for one to two days until negative test results are released. Transportation from the airport/s to the declared accommodation will have to be provided by the host company or government agency subject to prevailing health measures.<sup>2<sup> Travellers will bear the costs of the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for up to 14 days of the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport.<sup>3</sup>

Travellers to Singapore must use the TraceTogether app and SafeEntry<sup>4</sup>, take their temperature twice daily, report their health status to the host company or government agency, and adhere to prevailing public health requirements for the duration of their stay in Singapore.

#### 22. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above. More information on the app can be found at <https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg>.

#### 23. What is SafeEntry?

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FINs and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

More information can be found at <https://www.safeentry.gov.sg>.

### **Returning to Brunei**

#### 24. Do I need to be tested again in Singapore before I return to Brunei? Do I need to be quarantined or be tested again upon return to Brunei?

RGL returnees to Brunei currently do not need to be tested again in Singapore before returning to Brunei.

Upon their arrival back in Brunei, travellers will be subject to a 14-day Isolation Notice, which will be served at the airport, with costs to be borne by the travellers or sponsoring agency. However, returning travellers may qualify for a shortened isolation period upon submitting a negative result from a COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to departure in Singapore.

As the specific requirements may change over time, the returnee should verify the latest requirements with the Brunei government.

### **Testing Arrangements**

#### 6. Where do I take a pre-departure PCR test in Singapore? How much does it cost to take the PCR test, and can I pay for it with MediSave or insurance?

The RGL traveller departing for Brunei can make an appointment in advance at certain clinics in Singapore for a pre-departure test at the traveller’s cost. The traveller must take the test within 72 hours before departure, and obtain a health certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19.

The list of clinics that can perform pre-departure COVID-19 PCR tests and details on the procedure to book an appointment are at **<a href="#annex">ANNEX</a>**. Testing for fast lane arrangements should only be carried out at these clinics at the moment. An eligible RGL traveller should contact the clinic directly for testing.

The traveller will need to adhere to the clinic’s cut-off timings for the pre-departure tests to ensure that he/she is able to obtain the test results in time to be allowed to check-in for his/her flight.

The traveller must present at the clinic, a copy of the Entry Travel Pass which confirms that he/she was granted approval by the relevant authorities to travel to Brunei under the Singapore-Brunei RGL, before the swab test can be administered.

The traveller should expect to pay up to S$200 (inclusive of GST) for the pre-departure COVID-19 RT-PCR test. This is not payable by MediSave, MediShield Life and Integrated Shield Plans.

#### 7. I had a swab done previously for Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). Can I use the test results for travel under the RGL?

Travellers with Acute Respiratory Infection symptoms should not travel. They should postpone their travel plans.

#### 8. What tests will I be subject to upon arrival in Brunei? Will I be subject to a serology test in Brunei?

The traveller to Brunei will be subject to a COVID-19 PCR test at the designated COVID-19 testing centre on the following day after arrival. The traveller should expect to pay about $350 for the COVID-19 PCR test.

Minimally, a traveller should have on hand his/her negative COVID-19 PCR test result, a valid visa, proof of installation of the BruHealth application, a valid boarding pass, valid proof of payment for post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, proof of hotel reservation in Brunei, and the approved Entry Travel Pass issued by the Bruneian government specifically for essential business or official travel under the RGL.

As the specific requirements may evolve over time, the traveller should seek an update on the latest requirements with his/her local host company or government agency.

### **Health Measures in Brunei**

#### 11. Do I need to be quarantined upon arrival in Brunei?

The traveller will be isolated at his or her declared hotel of choice and be tested for COVID-19 on the following day after arrival. The hotel will arrange transport for the traveller for testing at a designated testing centre. After undergoing the PCR test, the traveller must remain under isolation until the test results are released, with a usual turnaround time of 24 hours. The traveller or the receiving party in Brunei will bear the costs of the post-arrival test, transport from airport to hotel, and the isolation in the designated accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for up to 14 days of the traveller’s stay in Brunei.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested positive for COVID-19, he or she will be promptly accorded the necessary medical treatment by the Government of Brunei. The traveller or their receiving party will bear the cost of medical treatment in Brunei.

#### 12. What other health measures will I be subject to in Brunei? What would qualify as a “controlled itinerary” in Brunei?

The traveller must follow local COVID-19 prevention and control measures for the duration of his or her stay in Brunei.

This includes downloading and using the BruHealth application. The traveller is required to self-report their health condition on a daily basis on the BruHealth application for a period of 14 days from arrival or throughout his or her stay in Brunei, if the duration of stay is less than 14 days, even when they have left isolation. The traveller must scan in their locations at all times on the BruHealth application using the QR codes displayed at all premises.

The host company or government agency will ensure that the itinerary is adhered to, and provide private transport for the traveller for up to 14 days of the traveller’s stay in Brunei. The traveller is not allowed to use public transportation, taxis, or ride-hailing services.

The traveller can only commute between his/her residence and the workplace via private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport (i.e., no public transport allowed).

The traveller should verify the latest requirements of the Bruneian authorities with his/her local host company or government agency.

### **Returning to Singapore**

#### 13. What health measures will I be subject to upon returning to Singapore after my RGL travel?

From 1 September 2020, 0000hrs, Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders returning from their travel to Brunei Darussalam are not required to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN), and will instead undergo a COVID-19 test upon arrival and be allowed to continue their activities in Singapore if the test is negative. Long-Term Pass holders returning on the RGL should present the Entry Travel Pass issued by Brunei upon arrival in Singapore for re-entry into Singapore, and they need not separately seek re-entry approval from other Singapore Government agencies.

However, should prevailing health policy require a SHN, Singapore-based travellers returning from their travel on the Singapore-Brunei RGL may be exempted from SHN if they:
- Undertake a COVID-19 PCR test at their own cost at authorised health centres designated by the Government of Brunei within 72 hours prior to their departure from Brunei, and obtain the negative test result prior to departure.
- Undertake a COVID-19 PCR test at the airport at their own cost upon arrival in Singapore and remain in isolation until they have been notified of their on-arrival test results. You are strongly encouraged to pre-register and make advance payment for the PCR test via this link to minimise processing time at the airport: <https://changiairport.com/safetravel/>.
- Produce the following documents to ICA officers at the immigration checkpoint in Singapore:
  - Approved Entry Travel Pass; and
  - Negative COVID-19 PCR test result obtained 72 hours prior to departure from Brunei.

Travellers are also reminded to submit their health declarations via ICA’s SG Arrival Card e-Service up to three days prior to their arrival in Singapore.

The authorised health centres designated by the Government of Brunei for pre-departure COVID-19 testing are as follows:
1. Sports Complex Swab Centre RIPAS Hospital
2. SARI Centre, Suri Seri Begawan Hospital
3. Berakas Health Centre
4. PAPHMWHB Gadong Health Centre
5. Pengkalan Batu Health Centre
6. Seria Health Centre

Please disregard the electronic SHN which you may receive via email upon submission of the Electronic Health Declaration through ICA’s SG Arrival Card e-Service, provided that the conditions above are met. If the above conditions are not met, travellers will be subjected to the prevailing health regulations in Singapore upon arrival in Singapore, including the requirement to serve SHN. For more information about the SHN issued by ICA, please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/shn>.

#### 14. Do I have to pay for my COVID-19 medical bills if I am found to have COVID-19 upon return from Brunei?

Travellers will be responsible for charges for COVID-19 treatment if symptoms develop within 14 days of arrival. Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who travelled on permitted travel arrangements may access Government subsidies and MediShield Life/Integrated Shield Plan to help pay for their bills. Long-Term Pass Holders who travelled on permitted travel arrangements may tap on their usual financing arrangements, such as foreign worker insurance.

Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders should retain the PDF copy of the Entry Travel Pass which confirms that he/she was granted approval by the relevant authorities to travel to Brunei under the RGL. The document is to be presented to the hospital as an indication of eligibility for Government subsidies, MediShield Life/Integrated Shield Plan or any other form of coverage (if applicable), should he/she be tested positive for COVID-19 upon return from Brunei via the RGL.

##### 2. What is the latest I have to present at the clinic, based on my departure flight timing?

You should make an appointment that fits your required testing window, and be present at the clinic early for the appointment.

<u>You must be present at least 2 hours prior to, and no later than, the stipulated cut-off timing in the table below.</u> Travellers who do not adhere to this cut-off timing will **not** be able to obtain the results in time for departure.

| Flight departure time | Latest Cut-off Test Timing |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 12:00am to 9:29am | 10.00am two calendar days before flight |
| 9:30am to 3:29pm | 4:00pm two calendar days before flight |
| 3.30pm to 11.59pm | 10:00am the day before flight |

*Example:*
*If a traveller’s departure flight time is 12pm on 20 August and the required test must be done within 72 hours of departure, the traveller should take the swab from 12pm on 17 August onwards, until the cut-off timing.*

*The latest the traveller can present himself/herself is by 4pm on 18 August.*

##### 3. How can I make an appointment for pre-departure PCR testing?

For Brunei, the pre-departure test must be done within 72 hours prior to departure.

Please call the clinic and book your test slot before the Cut-Off Test Timing in the schedule above. This is to ensure that you will have sufficient time to meet the RGL requirements.

##### 4. How far in advance should I make an appointment for the pre-departure PCR test?

Due to limited slots, please make your appointment with the clinic **as early as possible**, once your flight timing is confirmed and your RGL application is approved.

Please refer to the **Schedule for the “Latest Cut-off Test Timing” and book your test slot within the indicated timing**. This is to ensure that you meet the RGL requirements.

If you do not make a prior appointment, please note that:
1. There is no guarantee that there will be a test slot for you; and
2. You may not get your results in time for your flight to qualify for RGL arrangements. Travellers who miss the cut-off test timing will <u>not</u> be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.

##### 5. What details will I need to book an appointment for the PCR test?

Please have the following information on hand when making an appointment for your test:
1. Identification or passport numbers
2. Departure flight timing
3. Possible times for your test slot: Please refer to the Test Schedule to confirm your timing. 
4. Address in Singapore 
5. Contact number 
6. Email address 

##### 6. What documents should I bring for my appointment?

Please bring the following:
1. Identity card or passport 
2. PDF copy of the Entry Travel Pass which confirms that you are granted approval by the relevant authorities to travel to Brunei under the Singapore-Brunei RGL 
3. Softcopy showing your departure flight timing

##### Testing

##### 7. What if I miss my test timing? What if I take my test after the Cut-off Test Timing?

Travellers who miss the Cut-off Test Timing will <u>not</u> be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.

Please make arrangements early for your test slot so that you can qualify for the RGL arrangements.

##### 8. What happens if the clinic assesses that I am unable to receive the PCR test for unforeseen circumstances?

If you are unable to receive the test, you may wish to reschedule your flight, if you still wish to tap on the RGL arrangement.

For those travelling to Brunei Darussalam, sponsors may seek exemption from the Ministry of Health Brunei Darussalam via e-mail to <etp.health@moh.gov.bn>. However, health measures against exempted travellers may be different from those who have undergone pre-departure testing in Singapore.

##### Test Results

##### 9. When can I expect to get my PCR test results?

You will receive your PCR test results and memo at least 3 hours before your flight.

The clinic will email the results to your email address. You will need to print and bring the memo overseas yourself.
