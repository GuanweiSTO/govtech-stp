## **Application Process for Residents in Brunei**

### **Application**

#### 1. Who is eligible to apply to travel to Singapore under the RGL?

Persons of all nationalities who are legal residents in Brunei, who need to make single-entry, <u>short-term</u> essential travel for business and official purposes, between Singapore and Brunei.

#### 2. I am a Singapore Citizen / Singapore Permanent Resident / Singapore Long-Term Pass holder* who is resident in Brunei. Am I eligible to apply for the RGL?

Yes. All residents in Brunei who need to make <u>short-term</u> essential business or official travel between Singapore and Brunei are eligible to apply for the RGL.

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;"><em>Singapore Long-Term Pass holders who are eligible to apply for RGL travel include holders of MOM-issued work passes (e.g. Employment Pass, EntrePass, Personalised Employment Pass, S Pass, Work Permit, Dependent’s Pass) and holders of the ICA-issued Long-Term Visit Pass.</em></p>

#### 3. What is a SafeTravel Pass?

A SafeTravel Pass allows residents in Brunei to seek entry into Singapore under the RGL. It will be valid for one single entry into Singapore anytime within the stipulated week (0000hrs Monday to 2359hrs Sunday). Travellers must enter Singapore within this stipulated week, and can stay in Singapore for the duration of their Visit Pass issued to them in Singapore. For example, if the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass is valid from 7 to 14 September 2020, he/she must seek entry into Singapore within this period, and can stay for the duration of the Visit Pass issued to him/her at the checkpoint.

SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass.

#### 4. Do Bruneian citizens and residents still need to apply to exit the country?

Yes, Brunei citizens and residents travelling to Singapore under the RGL will still need to apply for Exit Travel via Brunei’s PMO. Information on the application can be found on <http://www.pmo.gov.bn/travelportal/Home.aspx>.

#### 5. How do residents in Brunei apply for a SafeTravel Pass to travel to Singapore under the RGL? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a SafeTravel Pass? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit?

Residents in Brunei seeking to travel to Singapore for short-term essential business or official travel via the RGL must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly, or through a sponsoring government agency.<sup>1</sup> Host companies submitting applications for a SafeTravel Pass directly can do so at <https://go.gov.sg/rglapp>.

When applying for the SafeTravel Pass, Proof of Residency in Brunei is required. Bruneian Citizens should present a copy of their passport or their yellow ID card for submission. Non-Bruneian Citizens who are resident in Brunei should present a copy of their Bruneian long-term pass ID for submission. Accepted Brunei ID cards include (a) purple ID cards issued to Permanent Residents who are holders of foreign passports and Certificates of Identity, and (b) green ID cards issued to foreigners residing more than 3 months (e.g. holder of employment pass, dependent pass, student pass and visit pass).

The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open 20 working days (excluding the date of application and date of entry) before the day of the traveller’s planned departure. The processing of the application can take up to 7 working days. Applications submitted less than 7 working days from planned departure will not be accepted. You are encouraged to apply for the SafeTravel Pass as early as possible, factoring in the time necessary for the processing of the SafeTravel Pass application, visa application (if needed) and taking a pre-departure COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test before departure for Singapore.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the applicant and the sponsoring company / government agency by email. With this letter, an approved traveller who is a visa-required passport holder will proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels (Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, local contact or companies) at least 4 working days before departure. If the approved traveller already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The traveller can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>. 

Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Bruneian citizens) will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved traveller will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the SG Arrival Card (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/>), within 3 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

Within 72 hours prior to the arrival in Singapore, the sponsoring company or government agency should submit the traveller’s negative COVID-19 PCR test result and controlled itinerary in Singapore at <https://go.gov.sg/rglsuppdocs>.

The traveller is required to produce a valid SafeTravel Pass, a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders), a return air ticket and a negative COVID-19 PCR test result obtained within 72 hours before departure for pre-boarding checks at the airlines’ check-in counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding.

#### 6. Can tourists apply for SafeTravel Passes?

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists.

Foreigners who are short-term travellers travelling from Brunei Darussalam may also seek entry into Singapore by applying for an Air Travel Pass at <https://go.gov.sg/atpsg>. Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders are not required to apply for an Air Travel Pass to travel to Singapore from Brunei Darussalam. However, Singapore Long-Term Pass holders will still have to seek entry approval from the relevant Singapore Government agencies before travelling to Singapore.

#### 7. Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner?

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

#### 8. Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

No payment is required.

#### 9. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can apply for a SafeTravel Pass. Every entry to Singapore requires a new SafeTravel Pass application.

If the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass has expired, he/she should submit a new application.

One traveller can only hold one valid SafeTravel Pass **for a single entry into Singapore** at any point in time. Please refrain from submitting multiple SafeTravel Pass applications or submitting new applications when you already have a valid SafeTravel Pass on hand. Duplicate applications will be rejected.

#### 10. What visa will I be eligible for under the RGL, and what is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore? 

Every application for a visa, including the type of visa granted, will be considered on its own merits and subject to approval. If the approved traveller already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/ she need not apply for a new visa. The traveller can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>.

Those who did not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Bruneian citizens) will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

Travellers who are granted entry into Singapore are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### 11. How can I further extend my Visit Pass / stay when I am in Singapore, if necessary? 

All applications for extension of Visit Pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-Service (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend>) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the Visit Pass to avoid overstaying. Extension of Visit Pass will not be accepted over the counter. Each application is considered on its own merits.

#### 12. Why was my application rejected and what can I do?

SafeTravel Pass applications may be rejected for reasons, including the following:
- **The quota for the week of entry that the application was submitted was fully utilised.** In this situation, you may consider submitting an application for a SafeTravel Pass for a different week of entry.
- **Application exceeds permissible window, i.e. not within 20 to 7 working days prior to departure.** In this situation, please ensure that you submit the application 20 working days prior to the date of entry into Singapore at the earliest, and 7 working days before the date of entry into Singapore at the latest.
- **Inadequate information provided.**

#### 13. I have submitted the necessary supporting documents prior to my departure from Brunei to Singapore. Why did I receive a notification that the submission was unsuccessful?

You might have submitted the supporting documents earlier than the 72-hour window before the declared date of departure from Brunei. You should submit the supporting documents only after receiving the results of the COVID-19 PCR test which has to be taken within <u>72 hours</u> prior to departure from Brunei. Please resubmit the necessary documents within the stipulated window prior to departure.

Do also ensure that the supporting documents submitted are in the correct format (pdf., jpeg.).

#### 14. Can I use the RGL to come to Singapore for long-term work?

The RGL is only for short-term essential business and official travel, and not for long-term work. Travellers seeking to enter Singapore for long-term work may wish to visit <https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits> for more information on a separate scheme.

#### 15. Can I use the RGL to come to Singapore for long-term study?

The RGL is only for short-term essential business and official travel, and not for long-term study. Travellers seeking to enter Singapore for study may wish to visit <https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/entry-approval-required-for-all-long-term-pass-holders> for more information.

#### 16. Can I use the RGL to transit through Singapore?

The RGL is only for short-term essential business and official travel between Singapore and Brunei, and not for transit through Singapore.

### **Pre-Departure Measures in Brunei**

#### 17. What health measures must I take in Brunei before departing for Singapore?

They must monitor their health status before departure from Brunei, undergo a pre-departure PCR test in Brunei at least once within 72 hours before departure, and obtain a certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19 issued by the following authorised health centres designated by the Government of Brunei:

### **Testing Arrangements Upon Arrival in Singapore**

#### 19. What COVID-19 tests will I be subject to upon arrival in Singapore? Where will the COVID-19 PCR test be administered? What are the payment modes accepted for the COVID-19 PCR test?

Travellers coming in on the RGL will be directed to take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at Changi Airport or Seletar Airport in Singapore. The traveller must take the COVID-19 PCR test at the assigned swabbing station within the airport. Please approach the airport ground staff upon arrival for assistance.

Travellers are encouraged to pre-register and pre-pay for the COVID-19 PCR test prior to entry into Singapore. Pre-registration and pre-payment can be made on the online portal at <https://safetravel.changiairport.com>. Travellers should expect to pay around S$300 (inclusive of GST) for the test upon arrival at the airport.

#### 20. What if I test positive for COVID-19 in Singapore?

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will be given medical treatment accordingly. Travellers will be responsible for charges for COVID-19 treatment if symptoms develop within 14 days of arrival.

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who travelled on permitted travel arrangements may access Government subsidies and MediShield Life/Integrated Shield Plan to help pay for their bills. Long-Term Pass Holders who travelled on permitted travel arrangements may tap on their usual financing arrangements, such as foreign worker insurance. Travellers should furnish the relevant supporting documents to indicate their status as an RGL traveller.

Note that all Short-Term Pass Holders will be accorded the necessary medical treatment at their cost. Travellers are encouraged to take up health insurance while travelling.

### **Health Measures in Singapore**

#### 21. What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore?

RGL travellers from Brunei must take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore, and remain isolated in a declared self-sourced accommodation (non-residential address only) for one to two days until negative test results are released. Transportation from the airport/s to the declared accommodation will have to be provided by the host company or government agency subject to prevailing health measures.<sup>2<sup> Travellers will bear the costs of the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for up to 14 days of the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport.<sup>3</sup>

Travellers to Singapore must use the TraceTogether app and SafeEntry<sup>4</sup>, take their temperature twice daily, report their health status to the host company or government agency, and adhere to prevailing public health requirements for the duration of their stay in Singapore.

#### 22. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

#### 23. What is SafeEntry?

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FINs and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

More information can be found at <https://www.safeentry.gov.sg>.

### **Returning to Brunei**

#### 24. Do I need to be tested again in Singapore before I return to Brunei? Do I need to be quarantined or be tested again upon return to Brunei?

RGL returnees to Brunei currently do not need to be tested again in Singapore before returning to Brunei.

Upon their arrival back in Brunei, travellers will be subject to a 14-day Isolation Notice, which will be served at the airport, with costs to be borne by the travellers or sponsoring agency. However, returning travellers may qualify for a shortened isolation period upon submitting a negative result from a COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to departure in Singapore.
