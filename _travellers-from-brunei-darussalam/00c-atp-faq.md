### **Air Travel Pass (ATP)**

#### 1. Why must visitors enter Singapore only on direct flights without transit?

This is to protect public health in Singapore by ensuring that visitors are not travelling to Singapore via a country with high virus prevalence rates.

#### 2. How long is the validity of an ATP?

An ATP is valid for single entry into Singapore on the visitor’s intended date of arrival into Singapore and seven days from that date.

#### 3. How long will it take for an ATP application to be processed?

We will endeavour to get back to the applicant within three working days.

#### 4. Do visitors travelling with family members need to apply an ATP for every individual?

Yes, each visitor will require an ATP. In the case of a minor (below 18 years old), consent must be given by the parent or guardian for the application.

#### 5. Is there a limit to the number of times visitors can apply for an ATP?

There is no limit to the number of times visitors can apply for an ATP. Every entry into Singapore requires a new ATP application.

#### 6. Can visitors use the ATP to transit/transfer through Singapore?

No, the ATP is for visitors who intend to enter Singapore.

#### 7. Do visitors with a valid ATP need to apply for a separate visa to enter Singapore?

Once the ATP approval letter has been issued, visitors who are visa-required passport holders must separately obtain a visa for entry into Singapore.

If visitors already have existing visas, the visa suspension will be lifted when the ATP is approved. There is no need to apply for a new visa. Visitors who were not required to obtain a visa for entry prior to the COVID-19 pandemic do not have to obtain a visa.

Visitors may refer to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority of Singapore’s (ICA) website (<https://www.ica.gov.sg/visitor/visitor_entryvisa>) for information on visa requirements and application.

#### 8. How long can visitors stay in Singapore?

The duration of stay in Singapore will be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### **Post-Arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test**

#### 9. What happens if visitors refuse to undergo the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test?

If visitors refuse to undergo the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, they may be refused entry into Singapore and have their ATP cancelled. Under such situation, visitors may also be liable to bear the cost of repatriation, and any other costs while waiting to be repatriated.

#### 10. Do children need to undergo a post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test?

Children (aged 12 years old or younger in that calendar year) are not required to undergo a post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test. However, children whose close contacts are found to be tested positive for COVID-19 will be required to take the test.

#### 11. How much is the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test at the airport?

The cost of the COVID-19 PCR test is S$300 (inclusive of Goods and Services Tax). Visitors will bear the cost of the test in Singapore.

To expedite the COVID-19 PCR test at the airport, visitors are strongly encouraged to pre-book and make payment at <https://safetravel.changiairport.com>.

#### 12. What types of accommodation do visitors need to use while waiting for their test results?

The accommodation must be non-residential, with an individual room and attached toilet.

Visitors are required to bear the cost of their accommodation in Singapore. Visitors may refer to the Singapore Hotel Association (SHA) website [www.sha.org.sg](https://www.sha.org.sg) for the list of hotels approved to receive visitors travelling to Singapore.

### **Contact Tracing – TraceTogether App**

#### 13. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track visitors movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and ids only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

More information on the app can be found at <https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg>.

#### 14. Must every visitor download the TraceTogether app?

Yes, all visitors to Singapore must download the TraceTogether app. They must download the app prior to departing for Singapore.

Visitors aged 12 years old or younger in that calendar year and travelling with a parent or guardian are exempted from this requirement. Visitors with disabilities and/or special needs with a valid medical certificate are also exempted.

#### 15. What happens if visitors do not have mobile devices to download the TraceTogether app?

All visitors must have a mobile device to download the Tracetogether app. They are responsible for ensuring that their mobile devices are compatible with the TraceTogether app, and may be refused boarding and entry into Singapore if they are unable to download the TraceTogether app on their mobile devices.

Visitors aged 12 years old or younger in that calendar year and travelling with a parent or guardian are exempted from this requirement. Visitors with disabilities and/or special needs with a valid medical certificate are also exempted from this requirement.

#### 16. Can visitors switch off their mobile devices while in Singapore?

No, visitors must keep mobile devices and the Bluetooth function switched on at all times while in Singapore.

#### 17. Can visitors uninstall the TraceTogether app upon departing from Singapore?

To facilitate contact tracing if visitors are tested positive for COVID-19, all TraceTogether data must also be retained for the duration of their stay in Singapore and for a consecutive period of 14 days after departing from Singapore.

### **Others**

#### 18. What must visitors present to airline staff during check-in at the departure airport for Singapore?

When checking in at the departure airport, visitors must present the following to the airline staff:
- a valid ATP approval letter (electronic or physical copy) for the intended week of entry into Singapore;
- a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders); and
- a mobile device with the TraceTogether app downloaded. Those aged 12 years old or young in that calendar year and travelling with a parent or guardian are exempted from this requirement. Visitors with disabilities and/or special needs with a valid medical certificate are also exempted.
