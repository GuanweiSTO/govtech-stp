### **Application**

#### 1. Who is eligible to apply to travel to China under the fast lane?

Residents in Singapore (i.e., Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, Long-Term Pass holders) who need to make essential business or official travel between Singapore and the six fast lane regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Zhejiang).

The relevant Chinese government authorities will assess each application on a case-by-case basis.

#### 2.	How do Singapore residents apply to travel to China under the fast lane?

Residents in Singapore seeking to travel to China for essential business or official travel via the fast lane must be sponsored by either a company or a government agency in China, which will file an application on behalf of the applicant with the local provincial/municipal authorities.  As the application process and documents required for each province/municipality may vary, the local host company/government agency should check with the relevant local provincial/municipal authorities for more details. A list of these local authorities is at **ANNEX A**.

If the application is approved, a Letter of Invitation will be issued to the applicant. The approved applicant will thereafter submit a visa application and health declaration to the PRC Embassy in Singapore, which will issue the applicant a visa. For more details on visa application, please contact the PRC Embassy in Singapore.

#### 3. What visas will I be eligible for under the fast lane, and what is the visa duration in China?

The duration of the visas in China will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the Chinese authorities.

#### 4.	How can I further extend my visa duration when I am in China, if necessary?

The traveller’s host company or government agency should contact the local Entry-Exit Administration Bureau for more information.

#### 5.	Is the fast lane meant for long-term work and study?

The fast lane is only for short-term essential business and official travel, and not for long-term work or study.

Those seeking to enter China for purposes other than essential business and official travel should contact the PRC Embassy in Singapore for further details.

#### 6.	Where in China may I travel to? What are the approvals which I will need to obtain to do so?

The fast lane is for travel between Singapore and the six fast lane regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Zhejiang).

Travellers from Singapore who need to travel between adjacent fast lane regions in China (e.g., from Shanghai to Jiangsu, or Shanghai to Zhejiang, etc.) within the first 14 days upon arrival, shall, through the host company or government agency, acquire in advance the approval (i.e., Letter of Invitation) from the relevant provincial/municipal authorities of the next destination.

The traveller is only allowed to use the private transport designated by his/her host company/government agency to travel to other fast lane regions. Travel via plane, rail, inter-city buses or other means of public transportation is not allowed.

After the first 14 days, inter-provincial/municipal travel for the non-fast lane regions within China will be allowed for a fast lane traveller from Singapore, as long as he/she adheres to the same domestic travel restrictions imposed on residents in China to move between those provinces/municipalities concerned.

As some provinces/municipalities may require additional COVID-19 test(s) before the traveller is allowed to embark on inter-provincial/municipal travel, the traveller’s local host company or government agency should check with the relevant local provincial/municipality authorities if there are any such requirements.

#### 7.	Who can I contact for more information on the arrangements in China, e.g., accommodation and transport?

The traveller may contact his/her host company or government agency in China to make the necessary arrangements in China.

### **Test Arrangements**

#### 8.	Where do I take a pre-departure polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test in Singapore? How much does it cost to take the PCR test, and can I pay for it with MediSave or insurance?

A fast lane traveller departing for China can make an appointment in advance at certain clinics in Singapore for a pre-departure test at the traveller’s cost. The traveller must take the test within 48 hours before departure, and obtain a health certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19.

The list of clinics that can perform pre-departure COVID-19 tests is at **ANNEX B**. Testing for fast lane arrangements can only be carried out at these clinics. An eligible fast lane traveller can contact the clinic directly for testing.

The traveller will need to adhere to the clinic’s cut-off timings for the pre-departure tests to ensure that he/she is able to obtain the test results in time to be allowed to check-in for his/her flight.

The traveller should expect to pay about S$180 – S$200 (inclusive of GST) for the pre-departure test. This is not payable by MediSave, MediShield Life and Integrated Shield Plans.

#### 9.	What tests will I be subject to upon arrival in China? Will I be subject to a serology test in China?

A fast lane traveller to China will be subject to one PCR test and one serology test upon arrival.<sup>1</sup>

#### 10. What if I test positive for COVID-19 in China?

If tested positive for COVID-19 in China, the traveller will be accorded the necessary medical treatment by the local government at his/her cost.

#### 11. I have completely recovered from COVID-19, but may still test positive on the post-arrival serology test in China. May I still travel to China?

The Chinese authorities require a traveller to test negative for both the post-arrival PCR test and serology test before the traveller can proceed with his/her travel plans in China.

#### 12. Do I have to take another PCR test in China before I return to Singapore? If so, where can I do so?

Yes. Travellers returning to Singapore have to take a pre-departure PCR test in China at least once within 48 hours before departure, and obtain a certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19 from the medical institutions designated by the relevant authorities in China.

### **Pre-Departure in Singapore**

#### 13. What documentation do I need to present to the airline crew before I will be allowed to board a flight from Singapore to China?

Minimally, travellers should have on hand their negative COVID-19 swab test result, a valid visa and a Letter of Invitation.

### **Health Measures in China**

#### 14. Do I need to be quarantined upon arrival in China?

After undergoing a PCR test and serology test upon arrival, the traveller must remain in a centralised quarantine area designated by the local provincial/municipal government for one to two days until the test results are released. The traveller has to bear the costs of the post-arrival tests and the one to two days’ stay in the designated location.

If the traveller tests negative for both COVID-19 tests, the host company or government agency will transport the traveller directly from the above-mentioned location designated by the local provincial/municipal government to the workplace or residence.

#### 15. What other health measures will I be subject to in China? What would qualify as a “controlled itinerary” in China?

The traveller must follow local COVID-19 prevention and control measures for the duration of his/her stay in China, including downloading the local health QR code used in the province/municipality.

The host company or government agency will supervise the itinerary of and provide private transport for the traveller for the first 14 days upon his/her arrival in China.

The traveller can only commute between his/her residence and the workplace via a dedicated car and driver (i.e., no public transport allowed).

As the specific requirements may vary amongst provinces/municipalities, the traveller should verify the latest requirements of the provincial/municipal authorities with his/her local host company or government agency.

While a traveller no longer needs to adhere to a controlled itinerary after the first 14 days, he/she must still follow local COVID-19 prevention and control measures for the duration of his/her stay in China. As some provinces/municipalities may require the traveller to undergo a PCR test before being allowed to move beyond a controlled itinerary after the first 14 days, your local host company or government agency should verify the latest requirements with the relevant local provincial/municipality authorities.

### **Returning to Singapore**

#### 16. What health measures will I be subject to upon returning to Singapore after my fast lane travel?

Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, Long-Term Pass holders returning to Singapore from China will be subject to prevailing health regulations.

For prevailing policies related to returning Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders, please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19> for more details.

##### 17.	Do I have to pay for my COVID-19 medical bills if I am found to have COVID-19 upon return from China?

Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders who travel under the fast lane arrangement and comply with the terms of the fast lane arrangement will not be required to pay for their medical bills at public hospitals should they test positive for COVID-19 upon return from China, for as long as the Singapore Government is paying COVID-19 patient bills for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders.
