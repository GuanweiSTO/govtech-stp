---

### **Application**

#### 1. Who is eligible to apply to travel to China under the fast lane?

Residents in Singapore (i.e., Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, Long-Term Pass holders) who need to make essential business or official travel between Singapore and the six fast lane regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Zhejiang).

The relevant Chinese government authorities will assess each application on a case-by-case basis.

#### 2.	How do Singapore residents apply to travel to China under the fast lane?

Residents in Singapore seeking to travel to China for essential business or official travel via the fast lane must be sponsored by either a company or a government agency in China, which will file an application on behalf of the applicant with the local provincial/municipal authorities.  As the application process and documents required for each province/municipality may vary, the local host company or government agency should check with the relevant local provincial/municipal authorities for more details. A list of these local authorities is at **<a href="#annexa">ANNEX A</a>**.

If the application is approved, a Letter of Invitation specifically for essential business or official travel under the fast lane will be issued to the applicant. The approved applicant will thereafter submit a visa application and health declaration to the PRC Embassy in Singapore, which will issue the applicant a visa. The requirement to obtain a visa also applies to Singaporeans visiting China for less than 15 days, as the 15-day visa free facility for Singaporeans travelling to China remains suspended by the PRC government until further notice. For more details on visa application, please contact the PRC Embassy in Singapore.

The traveller should work with his/her local host company or government agency to verify that he/she has fulfilled the fast lane requirements of the provincial/municipal authorities prior to departure for China. Besides taking a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test and obtaining a negative test result within 48 hours before departure, this may also include other requirements such as keeping the local authorities informed of the traveller’s flight details.

#### 3. What visas will I be eligible for under the fast lane, and what is the visa duration in China?

The duration and type of the visas issued by China will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the Chinese authorities.

#### 4.	How can I further extend my visa duration when I am in China, if necessary?

The traveller’s host company or government agency should contact the local Entry-Exit Administration Bureau for more information.

#### 5.	Is the fast lane meant for long-term work and study?

The fast lane is only for short-term essential business and official travel, and not for long-term work or study.

Those seeking to enter China for purposes other than essential business and official travel should contact the PRC Embassy in Singapore for further details.

#### 6.	Where in China may I travel to? What are the approvals which I will need to obtain to do so?

The fast lane is for travel between Singapore and the six fast lane regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Zhejiang).

A traveller from Singapore who needs to travel between adjacent fast lane regions in China (e.g., from Shanghai to Jiangsu, or Shanghai to Zhejiang, etc.) within the first 14 days upon arrival, shall, through the host company or government agency, acquire in advance the approval (i.e., Letter of Invitation) from the relevant provincial/municipal authorities of the next destination.

The traveller is only allowed to use the private transport designated by his/her host company or government agency to travel to other fast lane regions. Travel via plane, rail, inter-city buses or other means of public transportation is not allowed.

After the first 14 days, inter-provincial/municipal travel for the non-fast lane regions within China will be allowed for a fast lane traveller from Singapore, as long as he/she adheres to the same domestic travel restrictions imposed on residents in China to move between those provinces/municipalities concerned.

As some provinces/municipalities may require additional COVID-19 test(s) before the traveller is allowed to embark on inter-provincial/municipal travel, the traveller’s local host company or government agency should check with the relevant local provincial/municipality authorities if there are any such requirements.

#### 7.	Who can I contact for more information on the arrangements in China, e.g., accommodation and transport?

The traveller may contact his/her host company or government agency in China to make the necessary arrangements in China.

### **Test Arrangements**

#### 8.	Where do I take a pre-departure PCR test in Singapore? How much does it cost to take the PCR test, and can I pay for it with MediSave or insurance?

A fast lane traveller departing for China can make an appointment in advance at certain clinics in Singapore for a pre-departure test at the traveller’s cost. The traveller must take the test within 48 hours before departure, and obtain a health certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19.

The list of clinics that can perform pre-departure COVID-19 tests isand details on the procedure to book an appointment are at **<a href="#annexb">ANNEX B</a>**. Testing for fast lane arrangements can only be carried out at these clinics at the moment. An eligible fast lane traveller can contact the clinic directly for testing.

The traveller will need to adhere to the clinic’s cut-off timings for the pre-departure tests to ensure that he/she is able to obtain the test results in time to be allowed to check-in for his/her flight.

The traveller must also obtain a letter from the PRC Embassy in Singapore which confirms that he/she has been granted approval by the relevant authorities in China to travel to China under the Singapore-China Fast Lane. This letter will be used as an indication of the traveller’s eligibility to take a pre-departure COVID-19 test. This letter must be presented at the clinic before the test can be administered.

The traveller should expect to pay up to S$200 (inclusive of GST) for the pre-departure test. This is not payable by MediSave, MediShield Life and Integrated Shield Plans.

#### 9.	What tests will I be subject to upon arrival in China? Will I be subject to a serology test in China?

A fast lane traveller to China will be subject to one PCR test and one serology test upon arrival.<sup>1</sup>

#### 10. What if I test positive for COVID-19 in China?

If tested positive for COVID-19 in China, the traveller will be accorded the necessary medical treatment by the local government at his/her cost.

#### 11. I have completely recovered from COVID-19, but may still test positive on the post-arrival serology test in China. May I still travel to China?

The Chinese authorities require a traveller to test negative for both the post-arrival PCR test and serology test before the traveller can proceed with his/her travel plans in China.

#### 12. Do I have to take another PCR test in China before I return to Singapore?

Travellers do not have to take another PCR test in China before returning to Singapore.

### **Pre-Departure in Singapore**

#### 13. What documentation do I need to present to the airline staff at check-in before I will be allowed to board a flight from Singapore to China?

Minimally, a traveller should have on hand his/her negative COVID-19 PCR test result, a valid visa and a Letter of Invitation issued by the Chinese provincial/municipal authorities of Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin or Zhejiang specifically for essential business or official travel under the fast lane.

As the specific requirements may vary amongst provinces/municipalities, the traveller should verify the latest requirements with his/her local host company or government agency.

### **Health Measures in China**

#### 14. Do I need to be quarantined upon arrival in China?

After undergoing a PCR test and serology test upon arrival, the traveller must remain in a centralised quarantine area designated by the local provincial/municipal government for one to two days until the test results are released. The traveller has to bear the costs of the post-arrival tests and the one to two days’ stay in the designated location.

If the traveller tests negative for both COVID-19 tests, the host company or government agency will transport the traveller directly from the above-mentioned location designated by the local provincial/municipal government to the workplace or residence.

#### 15. What other health measures will I be subject to in China? What would qualify as a “controlled itinerary” in China?

The traveller must follow local COVID-19 prevention and control measures for the duration of his/her stay in China, including downloading the local health QR code used in the province/municipality.

The host company or government agency will supervise the itinerary of and provide private transport for the traveller for the first 14 days upon his/her arrival in China.

The traveller can only commute between his/her residence and the workplace via a dedicated car and driver (i.e., no public transport allowed).

As the specific requirements may vary amongst provinces/municipalities, the traveller should verify the latest requirements of the provincial/municipal authorities with his/her local host company or government agency.

While a traveller no longer needs to adhere to a controlled itinerary after the first 14 days, he/she must still follow local COVID-19 prevention and control measures for the duration of his/her stay in China. As some provinces/municipalities may require the traveller to undergo additional COVID-19 test(s) before being allowed to move beyond a controlled itinerary after the first 14 days, your local host company or government agency should verify the latest requirements with the relevant local provincial/municipality authorities.

### **Returning to Singapore**

#### 16. What health measures will I be subject to upon returning to Singapore after my fast lane travel?

From 17 June 2020, 2359 hours, all returnees to Singapore from China will be issued with a 14-day Stay-Home -Notice (SHN) upon entry into Singapore.* They will also be required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test before the end of their SHN.

Returnees who are Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents may serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence. Returnees who are Long-Term Pass holders may serve their 14-day SHN at a place of residence that they or their family members own or are sole tenants of; or in suitable accommodations such as a hotel, at their own cost.

All persons under SHN must remain in their place of residence at all times. They will be subject to close monitoring of their whereabouts, through electronic monitoring as well as physical spot-checks. Strict enforcement action will be taken against those who breach the requirements of the SHN.

For more information about the SHN issued by ICA, please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/shn>.

Travellers returning to Singapore from China after their fast lane travel may submit an appeal for COVID-19 PCR test arrangements in place of the SHN to <COVID_STPOappeals@mti.gov.sg>. Each appeal will be considered on a case-by-case basis and should be submitted at least five working days before the traveller’s intended date of return to Singapore.

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">* <em>For a start, all travellers entering Singapore from 17 June 2020, 2359 hours, and who had remained in Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Mainland China, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam in the last consecutive 14 days prior to their entry, will no longer have to serve their SHN at dedicated SHN facilities.</em></p>

##### 17.	Do I have to pay for my COVID-19 medical bills if I am found to have COVID-19 upon return from China?

Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders who travel under the fast lane arrangement and comply with the terms of the fast lane arrangement will not be required to pay for their medical bills at public hospitals should they test positive for COVID-19 upon return from China, for as long as the Singapore Government is paying COVID-19 patient bills for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders.

Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders should retain the letter from the PRC Embassy in Singapore which confirms that he/she was granted approval by the relevant authorities in China to travel to China under the Singapore-China Fast Lane. This letter would be used as an indication of eligibility to be exempted from the medical bills incurred, should he/she be tested positive for COVID-19 upon return from China via the fast lane.

<sup>1</sup> A PCR test seeks to detect genetic sequences specific to COVID-19, and the sample is taken via a swab test from the nose, back of throat or sputum. A serology test seeks to detect antibodies produced by the immune system against COVID-19, and the sample is taken via a blood test.
