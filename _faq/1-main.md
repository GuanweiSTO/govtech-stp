#### 1. Who is eligible to apply to travel to Singapore under the fast lane?

Residents in China who need to make essential business or official travel between Singapore and the six fast lane regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang).

#### 2. I am a Singapore Citizen / Singapore Permanent Resident / Singapore Long-Term Pass holder who is resident in China. Am I eligible to apply for the fast lane?

Yes. All residents in China who need to make short-term essential business or official travel between Singapore and the six fast lane regions in China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang) are eligible to apply for the fast lane.

#### 3. How do residents in China apply to travel to Singapore under the fast lane? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a visa? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit?

Residents in China seeking to travel to Singapore for essential business or official travel via the fast lane must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can self-sponsor and file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly, or through a sponsoring government agency.<sup>1</sup> The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open from 20 to 5 working days before the day of the traveller’s planned departure.

In the initial launch commencing 8 June 2020, travellers sponsored by government agencies may submit applications for a SafeTravel Pass through their respective sponsoring government agencies. Direct applications by companies will be accepted in a later phase, to be announced.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the applicant and the sponsoring company / government agency by email within 3 working days.

With this letter, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder will proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels (Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, local contact or companies) at least 4 working days before departure. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>. Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for fast lane travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/entryanddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved applicant will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the SG Arrival Card, within three days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

The sponsoring company or government agency should log onto the SafeTravel Pass portal one to two days before the traveller’s departure to submit the traveller’s negative COVID-19 test result and controlled itinerary in Singapore. The traveller is required to produce a valid SafeTravel Pass, a negative COVID-19 swab test result, a return air ticket, and a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders) for pre-boarding checks at the airlines check-in counter and immigration counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding.

#### 4.	What is a SafeTravel Pass?

A SafeTravel Pass allows residents in China to enter Singapore under the fast lane. It will be valid for one single entry into Singapore anytime within the stipulated week (0000hrs Monday to 2359hrs Sunday). Travellers must enter Singapore within this stipulated week, and can stay in Singapore for the duration of their Visit Pass issued to them at the immigration checkpoint in Singapore. For example, if the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass is valid from 6 to 12 July 2020, he/she must enter Singapore within this period, and can stay for the duration of the Visit Pass issued to him/her at the checkpoint.

SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

Please send an email to <COVID_SAFETRAVELPASS@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass.

#### 5.	Can tourists apply for SafeTravel Passes?

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists.

#### 6.	Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner?

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

#### 7.	Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

No payment is required.

#### 8.	Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can apply for a SafeTravel Pass. Every entry to Singapore requires a new SafeTravel Pass application.

If the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass has expired, he/she should submit a new application.

#### 9. What visa will I be eligible for under the fast lane, and what is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore?

Every application for a visa, including the type of visa granted, will be considered on its own merits and subject to approval. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/ she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>. Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for fast lane travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/entryanddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

Travellers that are granted entry into Singapore are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### 10. How can I further extend my Visit Pass / stay when I am in Singapore, if necessary?

All applications for extension of Visit Pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-Service (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend>) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the Visit Pass to avoid overstaying.

Travellers must remain in any of the sending fast lane regions (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang) for seven days prior to departure for Singapore. They must monitor their health status before departure from the fast lane regions in China, undergo a pre-departure PCR test in China at least once within 48 hours before departure, and obtain a certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19 from the medical institutions designated by the relevant provincial/municipal government in China.

### **Health Measures in Singapore**

#### 18. What health measures will I will be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore?

Fast lane travellers from China must take a PCR test after arrival in Singapore, and remain isolated in a declared self-sourced accommodation (non-residential address only) for one to two days until their test results are released. Transportation from the airport to the declared accommodation will have to be provided by the host company or government agency subject to prevailing health measures. Travellers will bear the costs of the post-arrival PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for the first 14 days of the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport.

Travellers to Singapore must use the TraceTogether app, take their temperature twice daily, report their health status to the host company or government agency, and adhere to prevailing public health requirements for the duration of their stay in Singapore.

#### 19. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above. More information on the app can be found at <https://tracetogether.gov.sg>.


### **Returning to China**

#### 20. Do I need to be tested again in Singapore before I return to China? Do I need to be quarantined or be tested again upon return to China?

Fast lane returnees to China currently do not need to be tested again in Singapore before returning to China.

Upon their arrival back in China, they must adhere to the prevailing COVID-19 prevention and control measures of the Chinese government. This may include a 14-day quarantine or COVID-19 tests at the returnee’s cost, as required by most provinces/municipalities for international arrivals into China.

As the specific requirements may vary amongst provinces/municipalities, the returnee should verify the latest requirements with the relevant provincial/municipal authorities.
