### **Before entering Singapore**

#### **Visa Requirements**

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the applicant, as well as the sponsoring company or government agency.

With the SafeTravel Pass approval, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder must proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he or she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through [this page](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save).

**Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for fast lane travel.** These include passport holders from countries and regions with which Singapore has visa-free arrangements, as well as diplomatic and official passport holders. For more information on visa requirements, please visit [www.ica.gov.sg](https://www.ica.gov.sg/).

The approved applicant will also have to electronically submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations via the [SG Arrival Card](http://www.google.com), before departing for Singapore. International visitors can also access the SG Arrival Card on the [Visit Singapore Travel Guide App](http://www.google.com).

#### **Pre-Departure Measures**

Approved SafeTravel Pass travellers are required to do the following prior to travelling to Singapore:

- Monitor their health status before departure;
- Take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 48 hours before departure and obtain a certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19. The SafeTravel Pass applicant will bear the cost of the pre-departure PCR test.
- At pre-boarding checks, approved SafeTravel Pass travellers must produce:
  - A valid SafeTravel Pass,
  - A negative PCR test result,
  - A return air ticket
Otherwise, the traveller can be refused boarding.

### **Arrival and Stay in Singapore**

#### **Post-Arrival Measures**

The SafeTravel Pass traveller will undergo a **PCR test** upon arrival in Singapore. The SafeTravel Pass traveller will bear the costs of the post-arrival PCR test in Singapore.

The applicant must produce a valid SafeTravel Pass and a negative PCR test result (i.e., the result of the test done prior to departure from China) to arrival immigration. Applicants without these documents can be denied entry.

The host<sup>1</sup> company or government agency will transport the traveller directly from the airport to the declared self-sourced accommodation, adhering to prevailing health measures. The applicant must remain in **self-isolation** at the declared accommodation (non-residential address only) for one to two days until the test result is known.

#### **Measures during stay in Singapore**

SafeTravel Pass travellers to Singapore are required to download and use the [TraceTogether app](http://www.google.com) for the duration of their stay. If a traveller does not have a TraceTogether-compatible device, the host company or government agency shall provide one to the traveller.

In addition to abiding by prevailing local public health and safety distancing measures, SafeTravel Pass travellers must adhere to a **controlled itinerary** that is supervised by the host company or government agency for the first 14 days. The traveller is prohibited from using public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport.
