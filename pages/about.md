The SafeTravel Pass is a mandatory document for in-bound travellers from approved countries/regions seeking to make essential business and official travel to Singapore under Fast Lane arrangements.

As of 3 June 2020, Singapore has established Fast Lane arrangements with six Chinese provinces and municipalities (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang).

#### **Application**

Business or official travellers from these regions seeking to make essential travel to Singapore via the Fast Lane must be sponsored by either a Singapore-based company or a Singapore Government agency, which will file an application on behalf of the applicant for a SafeTravel pass.

### **Before entering Singapore**

#### **Visa Requirements**

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the applicant, as well as the sponsoring company or government agency.

With the SafeTravel Pass approval, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder must proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he or she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through [this page](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save).

**Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for fast lane travel.** These include passport holders from countries and regions with which Singapore has visa-free arrangements, as well as diplomatic and official passport holders. For more information on visa requirements, please visit <www.ica.gov.sg>

The approved applicant will also have to electronically submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations via the SG Arrival Card <insert hyperlink from ICA on SG Arrival Card >, before departing for Singapore. International visitors can also access the SG Arrival Card on the Visit Singapore Travel Guide App <insert hyperlink from STB>.
