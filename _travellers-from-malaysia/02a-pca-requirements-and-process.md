---

The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is an agreement between Singapore and Malaysia to allow residents from Malaysia to commute to Singapore on a periodic basis via the land border crossings at the Causeway and Second Link.

Under the PCA, approved travellers will be permitted to enter Singapore and are required to spend at least three consecutive months in Singapore. Applications will begin on [23 July 2020, 0000 hrs], and must be submitted at least [7 calendar] days prior to the preferred date of entry. [Approved travellers under PCA are allowed to enter Singapore, and periodically return to Malaysia for home leave after at least three consecutive months of stay in Singapore.] Subsequent entries into Singapore will require new applications.

A daily quota of 2,000 approved travelers are currently permitted to enter Singapore (as of [23 July 2020]). The daily quota is intended to regulate the flow of travelers exiting and returning to the country of work in order to maintain public health controls and resources.

### **Before entering Singapore**

#### Prior to Arrival

Prior to arrival at the immigration checkpoints, approved PCA travellers are required to:
- Monitor their health status on the date of entry prior to arrival at the immigration; 
- Ensure that they have a physical/digital copy of the approved PCA pass/document from relevant authority (TBD); 
- Ensure that the personal details indicated in the approved PCA pass/document are accurate; and
- Ensure that they are able to enter Singapore on the date of arrival that they indicated during the application and have been assigned in their approval email and approved PCA pass/document. 

Approved PCA travellers may only take one of the following transport options to travel from the immigration checkpoint from Malaysia to Singapore:

- Company provided transport (with a Malaysia driver) 
- Personal transport (declared in the application) 
- By foot

### **Arrival and Stay in Singapore**

#### Upon Arrival

At arrival immigration, approved PCA traveller must produce:
- A valid PCA Pass for the intended date of arrival, 
- A valid passport and work pass to enter Singapore, and
- A proof of payment for PCR swab test. 

Otherwise, the traveller will be refused entry into Singapore.

#### Post-Arrival Measures

After immigration, the approved traveller will have to take a company transport, their personal transport (e.g. motorbikes), or private hire vehicles directly from the immigration checkpoint to the declared self-sourced SHN accommodation, adhering to prevailing health measures and without stopping at any destination along the journey. The traveller must remain in the declared SHN accommodation for the next 14 days from the date of entry into Singapore.

The approved traveller will only be permitted to leave his/her declared SHN accommodation for his/her PCR swab test. The traveller will receive a SMS message indicating an assigned date to take a PCR swab test at the designated test site. The date and location of the test will be sent to the approved traveler via the Singapore mobile number that was declared in the application within [XX days]. The traveller is prohibited from using public transport for this purpose, with the exception of private hire vehicles or cohorted company transport. <em>(Note: The date of the test may not necessarily be the date of entry into Singapore.)</em>

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the traveller can move to his/her final accommodation and travel to his/her workplace after the 14 days of SHN. If tested positive for COVID-19, the traveller will undergo medical treatment at his/her cost.

The sponsoring company will bear the costs of the accommodations (both SHN and post-SHN) and post-arrival PCR swab test in Singapore.

#### Measures during stay in Singapore

Approved PCA travellers will be required to abide by prevailing local public health and safety distancing measures throughout their entire stay in Singapore.

After the first 14 days, approved PCA travellers will be allowed to use public transportation.

Travellers without a valid PCA Pass will be refused entry into Singapore.
