The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is an agreement between Singapore and Malaysia to allow residents from Malaysia to commute to Singapore on a periodic basis via the land border crossings at the Causeway and Second Link.

Under the PCA, approved travellers will be permitted to enter Singapore and are required to spend at least three consecutive months in Singapore. Applications will begin on [23 July 2020, 0000 hrs], and must be submitted at least [7 calendar] days prior to the preferred date of entry. [Approved travellers under PCA are allowed to enter Singapore, and periodically return to Malaysia for home leave after at least three consecutive months of stay in Singapore.] Subsequent entries into Singapore will require new applications.

A daily quota of 2,000 approved travelers are currently permitted to enter Singapore (as of [23 July 2020]). The daily quota is intended to regulate the flow of travelers exiting and returning to the country of work in order to maintain public health controls and resources.

## **Eligibility**

You are eligible to apply for the PCA to enter Singapore if you:
- Are a Malaysia Citizen / Permanent Resident / Long-Term Pass holder<sup>1</sup>;
- Hold valid long-term visas for business and work purposes in Singapore; and
