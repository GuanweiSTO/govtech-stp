## **Application Process for Residents in Malaysia**

### **Application**

#### 1. Who is eligible to apply to travel to Singapore under the RGL?

Persons of all nationalities who are legal residents in Malaysia, who need to make single-entry, <u>short-term</u> essential travel for business and official purposes, between Singapore and Malaysia.

#### 2. I am a Singapore Citizen / Singapore Permanent Resident / Singapore Long-Term Pass holder<sup>*</sup> who is resident in Malaysia. Am I eligible to apply for the fast lane?

Yes. All residents in Malaysia who need to make <u>short-term</u> essential business or official travel between Singapore and Malaysia are eligible to apply for the RGL.

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">* <em>Singapore Long-Term Pass holders who are eligible to apply for RGL travel include holders of MOM-issued work passes (e.g. Employment Pass, EntrePass, Personalised Employment Pass, S Pass, Work Permit, Dependent’s Pass) and holders of the ICA-issued Long-Term Visit Pass.</em></p>

#### 3. What is a SafeTravel Pass?

A SafeTravel Pass allows residents in Malaysia to seek <u>short-term</u> entry into Singapore under the RGL. It will be valid for one single entry into Singapore anytime within the stipulated week (0000hrs Monday to 2359hrs Sunday). Travellers must enter Singapore within this stipulated week, and can stay in Singapore for up to <u>14 days</u>. For example, if the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass is valid from 6 to 12 July 2020, he/she must seek entry into Singapore within this period, and can stay for up to 14 days from the date of arrival.

SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass.

#### 4. How do residents in Malaysia apply for a SafeTravel Pass to travel to Singapore under the RGL? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a SafeTravel Pass? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit?

Residents in Malaysia seeking to travel to Singapore for short-term essential business or official travel via the RGL must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can self-sponsor and file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly, or through a sponsoring government agency.<sup>1</sup> The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open from one to four weeks before the traveller’s intended week of departure.

From 10 August 2020, only business or official travellers sponsored by a Singapore Government agency may submit applications to use the Singapore-Malaysia Reciprocal Green Lane. Applications for company-sponsored travellers to use the Singapore-Malaysia Reciprocal Green Lane can be submitted in end-August.

When applying for the SafeTravel Pass, Proof of Residency in Malaysia is required. Malaysian Citizens should present a copy of their passport for submission. Non-Malaysian Citizens who are resident in Malaysia should present a copy of their Malaysian long-term pass ID for submission.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the sponsoring company / government agency by email within 3 working days.

With this letter, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder will proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels (Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, local contact or companies) at least 4 working days before departure. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>.

Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Malaysian citizens) will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved applicant will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the SG Arrival Card (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/>), within 3 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

The sponsoring company or government agency should log onto the SafeTravel Pass portal within 2 days before the traveller’s departure to submit the traveller’s negative COVID-19 PCR test result and controlled itinerary (of maximum 14 days’ stay) in Singapore.

The traveller is required to produce a valid SafeTravel Pass, a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders), and a negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result obtained within 72 hours before departure for pre-boarding checks at the airlines’ check-in counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding.

For travellers departing via land checkpoints, the traveller is required to produce a valid SafeTravel Pass, a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders), and a negative COVID-19 PCR test result obtained within 72 hours.

#### 5. Can tourists apply for SafeTravel Passes?

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists.

#### 6. Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner?

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

#### 7. Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

No payment is required.

#### 8. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can apply for a SafeTravel Pass. Every entry to Singapore requires a new SafeTravel Pass application.

However, a traveller with a valid SafeTravel Pass for a specific week of travel cannot apply for another SafeTravel Pass for the week of travel immediately before or after the specified week of travel.

If the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass has expired, he/she should submit a new application.

#### 9. What visa will I be eligible for under the RGL, and what is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore?

Every application for a visa, including the type of visa granted, will be considered on its own merits and subject to approval. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/ she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>.

Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Malaysian citizens) will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

#### 10. Can I use the RGL to come to Singapore for long-term work?

The RGL is only for short-term essential business and official travel, and not for long-term work. Travellers seeking to enter Singapore for long-term work may wish to visit the SafeTravel Website (<https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg>) for more information on the Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA), or visit [www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits) for more information on a separate scheme.

#### 11. Can I use the RGL to come to Singapore for long-term study?

The RGL is only for short-term essential business and official travel, and not for long-term study. Travellers seeking to enter Singapore for study may wish to visit <https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/entry-approval-required-for-all-long-term-pass-holders> for more information.

#### 12. Are there restrictions on how I can travel to Singapore?

Under the RGL, travellers can travel to Singapore by air via any non-stop flight route between airports in Singapore and Malaysia, as well as by land via the Causeway and Second Link.

The list of accredited private clinics and private hospitals by the Ministry of Health Malaysia that conduct the COVID-19 test can be found [here](http://medicalprac.moh.gov.my/v2/modules/mastop_publish/?tac=Senarai%20KPJKS%20yang%20telah%20diluluskan%20bagi%20COVID-19).

#### 15. What documentation do I need to present before I depart from Malaysia to Singapore?

Travellers by air and land are required to produce the following documents to the airline for pre-boarding checks and at the immigration counter respectively:
1. A valid SafeTravel Pass approval letter (the date of entry into Singapore must fall within the period of entry stated in the letter);
2. A valid visa to enter Singapore (for visa-required passport holders who are short-term visitors to Singapore); and
3. A valid certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure for Singapore (the certificate must be from the accredited laboratories by the Ministry of Health Malaysia).

### **Test Arrangements Upon Arrival in Singapore**

#### 16. What COVID-19 tests will I be subject to upon arrival in Singapore?

The traveller will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at Changi Airport, Seletar Airport, Woodlands Checkpoint or Tuas Checkpoint in Singapore.

For travellers entering Singapore by air, travellers are encouraged to pre-register and pre-pay for the COVID-19 PCR test prior to your entry into Singapore. Pre-registration and pre-payment can be made on the online portal at <https://safetravel.changiairport.com>. Travellers should expect to pay around S$300 (inclusive of GST) for the test upon arrival at the airport.

For travellers entering Singapore by land, travellers will make payment at the testing station located at Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoint. Only card payments or PayPal are accepted. Travellers should expect to pay around S$200 (inclusive of GST) for the test upon arrival at the land checkpoints.

#### 17. What if I test positive for COVID-19 in Singapore?

If tested positive for COVID-19, Short-Term Pass Holders will be accorded the necessary medical treatment at his/her cost.

For Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass Holders, the prevailing charging policies for COVID-19 treatment in public healthcare institutions will apply.

### **Health Measures in Singapore**

#### 18. What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore?

RGL travellers from Malaysia must take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore, and remain isolated in a declared self-sourced accommodation (non-residential address only) for one to two days until negative test results are released. Transportation from the airport/land checkpoints to the declared accommodation will have to be provided by the host company or government agency subject to prevailing health measures.<sup>2</sup> Travellers will bear the costs of the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for up to 14 days of the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport.<sup>3</sup>

#### 19. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

More information on the app can be found at [tracetogether.gov.sg](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg).

### **Returning to Malaysia**

#### 20. Do I need to be tested again in Singapore before I return to Malaysia? Do I need to be quarantined or be tested again upon return to Malaysia?

RGL returnees to Malaysia currently do not need to be tested again in Singapore before returning to Malaysia.

Upon their arrival back in Malaysia, they must adhere to the prevailing COVID-19 prevention and control measures of the Malaysian government. As the specific requirements may change over time, the returnee should verify the latest requirements with the relevant Malaysian authorities.

##### 2. What is the latest I have to be at the clinic, based on my departure flight timing?

You should make an appointment that fits your required testing window, and be present at the clinic early for the appointment.

<u>You must be present at least 2 hours prior to, and no later than, the stipulated cut-off timing in the table below.</u> Travellers who do not adhere to this cut-off timing will not be able to obtain the results in time for departure.

| Flight departure time | Latest Cut-off Test Timing |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 12:00am to 9:29am | 10.00am two calendar days before flight |
| 9:30am to 3:29pm | 4:00pm two calendar days before flight |
| 3.30pm to 11.59pm | 10:00am the day before flight |

*Example:*
*If a traveller’s departure flight time is 12pm on 20 August and the required test must be done within 72 hours of departure, the traveller should take the swab from 12pm on 17 August onwards, until the cut-off timing.*

*The latest the traveller can present himself/herself is by 4pm on 18 August.*

##### 3. How can I make an appointment for pre-departure PCR testing?

For Malaysia, the pre-departure test must be done within 72 hours prior to departure.

Please call the clinic and book your test slot before the Cut-Off Test Timing in the schedule above. This is to ensure that you will have sufficient time to meet the RGL requirements.

##### 4. How far in advance should I make an appointment for the pre-departure PCR test?

Due to limited slots, please make your appointment with the clinic **as early as possible**, once your flight timing and RGL requirements are confirmed.

Please refer to the **Schedule for the “Latest Cut-off Test Timing” and book your test slot within the indicated timing**. This is to ensure that you meet the RGL requirements.

If you do not make a prior appointment, please note that:
1. There is no guarantee that there will be a test slot for you; and
2. You may not get your results in time for your flight to qualify for RGL arrangements. Travellers who miss the cut-off test timing will <u>not</u> be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.

##### 5. What details will I need to book an appointment for the PCR test?

Please have the following information on hand when making an appointment for your test:
1. Identification or passport numbers
2. Departure flight timing
3. Possible times for your test slot: Please refer to the Test Schedule to confirm your timing. 
4. Address in Singapore
5. Contact number
6. Email address

##### 6. What documents should I bring for my appointment?

Please bring the following:
1. Identity card or passport
2. MyTravelPass
3. Softcopy showing your departure flight timing

##### Testing

##### 7. What if I miss my test timing? What if I take my test after the Cut-off Test Timing?

Travellers who miss the Cut-off Test Timing will <u>not</u> be able to obtain a test result in time for their scheduled departure.

Please make arrangements early for your test slot so that you can qualify for the RGL.

##### 8. What happens if the clinic assesses that I am unable to receive the PCR test for unforeseen circumstances?

If you are unable to receive the test, you may wish to reschedule your departure, if you still wish to tap on the RGL.

##### Test Results

##### 9. When can I expect to get my PCR test results?

You will receive your PCR test results and memo at least three hours before your scheduled departure.

The clinic will email the results to your email address. You will need to print and bring the memo overseas yourself.
