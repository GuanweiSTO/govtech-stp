## **Application Process for Residents in Malaysia**

### **Application**

#### 1. Who is eligible to apply to travel to Singapore under the RGL?

Persons of all nationalities who are legal residents in Malaysia, who need to make single-entry, <u>short-term</u> essential travel for business and official purposes, between Singapore and Malaysia.

#### 2. I am a Singapore Citizen / Singapore Permanent Resident / Singapore Long-Term Pass holder<sup>*</sup> who is resident in Malaysia. Am I eligible to apply for the RGL?

Yes. All residents in Malaysia who need to make <u>short-term</u> essential business or official travel between Singapore and Malaysia are eligible to apply for the RGL.

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">* <em>Singapore Long-Term Pass holders who are eligible to apply for RGL travel include holders of MOM-issued work passes (e.g. Employment Pass, EntrePass, Personalised Employment Pass, S Pass, Work Permit, Dependent’s Pass) and holders of the ICA-issued Long-Term Visit Pass.</em></p>

#### 3. What is a SafeTravel Pass?

A SafeTravel Pass allows residents in Malaysia to seek <u>short-term</u> entry into Singapore under the RGL. It will be valid for one single entry into Singapore anytime within the stipulated week (0000hrs Monday to 2359hrs Sunday). Travellers must enter Singapore within this stipulated week, and can stay in Singapore for up to <u>14 days</u>. For example, if the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass is valid from 6 to 12 July 2020, he/she must seek entry into Singapore within this period, and can stay for up to 14 days from the date of arrival.

SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass.

#### 4. How do residents in Malaysia apply for a SafeTravel Pass to travel to Singapore under the RGL? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a SafeTravel Pass? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit?

Residents in Malaysia seeking to travel to Singapore for short-term essential business or official travel via the RGL must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly, or through a sponsoring government agency.<sup>1</sup> Host companies submitting applications for a SafeTravel Pass directly can do so at <https://go.gov.sg/rglapp>.

When applying for the SafeTravel Pass, Proof of Residency in Malaysia is required. Malaysian Citizens should present a copy of their passport for submission. Non-Malaysian Citizens who are resident in Malaysia should present a copy of their Malaysian long-term pass ID for submission.

The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open 20 working days (excluding the date of application and date of entry) before the day of the traveller’s planned departure. The processing of the application can take up to 7 working days. Applications submitted less than 7 working days from planned departure will not be accepted. You are encouraged to apply for the SafeTravel Pass as early as possible, factoring in the time necessary for the processing of the SafeTravel Pass application, visa application (if needed) and taking a pre-departure COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the sponsoring company / government agency by email within 3 working days. With this letter, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder will proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels (Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, local contact or companies) at least 4 working days before departure. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>.

Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Malaysian citizens) will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved applicant will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the SG Arrival Card (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/>), within 3 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore.

Within 72 hours before the traveller’s departure from Malaysia, the sponsoring company or government agency should submit the traveller’s **negative COVID-19 test result and controlled itinerary** in Singapore at <https://go.gov.sg/rglsuppdocs>.

Travellers by air are required to produce a valid SafeTravel Pass, a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders), and a negative COVID-19 PCR test result obtained within 72 hours before departure for pre-boarding checks at the airlines’ check-in counter and immigration counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding.

Travellers departing via land checkpoints are required to produce a valid SafeTravel Pass, a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders), and a negative COVID-19 PCR test result obtained within 72 hours.

#### 5. What are the responsibilities of the host company who is self-sponsoring?

When a company is sponsoring a traveller, it will have to be responsible for the application of the SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller as well as the timely submission of the accompanying documents.

The host company should also ensure that the traveller abides by the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Malaysia RGL, and the prevailing health measures during his/her stay in Singapore. Authorities may ask for proof of adherence, including physical verification or SafeEntry Pass records (e.g. screenshots), to the controlled itinerary and other terms and conditions when the traveller is in Singapore.

You can access the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Malaysia RGL at <https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/malaysia/rgl/terms-and-conditions>. Actions will be taken against the traveller and the host company in the event of non-compliance.

#### 6. What qualifies as a “controlled itinerary”?

The controlled itinerary should consist of the time and location of the traveller’s whereabouts during his stay in Singapore. During the traveller’s stay in Singapore, the traveller can only commute between his/her non-residential accommodation and the workplace via private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport<sup>2</sup> (i.e., no public transport allowed). The controlled itinerary should reflect these requirements.

The host company will need to supervise the controlled itinerary of the traveller and report any changes, and provide private transport for the traveller during his/her stay in Singapore.

#### 7. Can tourists apply for SafeTravel Passes?

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists.

#### 8. Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner?

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

#### 9. Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

No payment is required.

#### 10. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass?

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can apply for a SafeTravel Pass. Every entry to Singapore requires a new SafeTravel Pass application.

If the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass has expired, he/she should submit a new application.

One traveller can only hold one valid SafeTravel Pass **for a single entry into Singapore** at any one point in time. Please refrain from submitting multiple SafeTravel Pass applications or submitting new applications when you already have a valid SafeTravel Pass on hand. Duplicate applications will be rejected.

#### 11. What visa will I be eligible for under the RGL, and what is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore?

Every application for a visa, including the type of visa granted, will be considered on its own merits and subject to approval. If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/ she need not apply for a new visa. The applicant can check his/her visa status through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save>.

Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Malaysian citizens) will not need to apply for a visa for RGL travel. Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

#### 12. How can I further extend my Visit Pass / stay when I am in Singapore, if necessary?

All applications for extension of Visit Pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-Service (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend>) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the Visit Pass to avoid overstaying. Extension of Visit Pass will not be accepted over the counter. Each application is considered on its own merits.

#### 13. My travel plans have changed/I incorrectly entered some information in my application. How can I amend the details of my SafeTravel Pass application/approved SafeTravel Pass?

Both the SafeTravel Pass application and issued SafeTravel Pass cannot be amended. Please ensure that all details of the application form are accurate at the point of submission.

#### 14. What if I have changes to my controlled itinerary?

The host company should be responsible for monitoring and reporting any deviation in your controlled itinerary. The host company should resubmit the updated controlled itinerary on behalf of the traveller via the ‘Submission of Supporting Documents for SafeTravel Pass Application’ Form, at <https://go.gov.sg/rglsuppdocs>. This should be done even if the traveller is already in Singapore.

#### 15. Why was my application rejected?

SafeTravel Pass applications may be rejected for reasons, including the following:
- The quota for the week of entry that the application was submitted was fully utilised. In this situation, you may consider submitting an application for a SafeTravel Pass for a different week of entry.
- Application filed out of permissible window, i.e. not within 20 to 7 working days prior to departure. In this situation, please ensure that you submit the application earliest 20 working days prior to the date of entry into Singapore, and latest 7 working days before the date of entry into Singapore.
- Inadequate information provided.

#### 16. I have submitted the necessary supporting documents prior to my departure from Malaysia to Singapore. Why did I receive a notification that the submission was unsuccessful?

You might have submitted the supporting documents earlier than the 72-hour window before the declared date of departure from Malaysia. You should submit only after receiving the results of the COVID-19 PCR test which has to be taken <u>within 72 hours</u> of departure from Malaysia. Please resubmit the necessary documents within the stipulated window prior to departure.

Do also ensure that the supporting documents submitted are in the correct format (pdf., jpeg.).

#### 17. Can I use the RGL to come to Singapore for long-term work?

The RGL is only for short-term essential business and official travel, and not for long-term work. Travellers seeking to enter Singapore for long-term work may wish to visit the SafeTravel Website (<https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg>) for more information on the Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA), or visit [www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits) for more information on a separate scheme.

#### 18. Can I use the RGL to come to Singapore for long-term study?

Under the RGL, travellers can travel to Singapore by air via any non-stop flight route between airports in Singapore and Malaysia, as well as by land via the Causeway and Second Link.

#### 20. Can I use the RGL to transit through Singapore?

The RGL is only for short-term essential business and official travel between Singapore and Malaysia, and not for transit through Singapore.

### **Test Arrangements Upon Arrival in Singapore**

#### 23. What COVID-19 tests will I be subject to upon arrival in Singapore? Where will the COVID-19 PCR test be administered? What are the payment modes accepted for the COVID-19 PCR test?

RGL travellers from Malaysia will be directed to take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at Changi Airport, Seletar Airport, Woodlands Checkpoint or Tuas Checkpoint in Singapore. To qualify for exemption from the Stay-Home-Notice (SHN) requirement, the Traveller must take the COVID-19 PCR test at the assigned swabbing station within the airport and land checkpoints. Please approach the airport ground staff and land checkpoint authorities upon arrival for assistance.

Travellers entering Singapore by air are encouraged to pre-register and pre-pay for the COVID-19 PCR test prior to your entry into Singapore. Pre-registration and pre-payment can be made on the online portal at <https://safetravel.changiairport.com>.

### **Health Measures in Singapore**

#### 25. What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore?

RGL travellers from Malaysia must take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore, and remain isolated in a declared self-sourced accommodation (non-residential address only) for one to two days until negative test results are released. Transportation from the airport/land checkpoints to the declared accommodation will have to be provided by the host company or government agency subject to prevailing health measures.<sup>3</sup> Travellers will bear the costs of the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport.<sup>4</sup>

#### 26. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above. More information on the app can be found at <https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg>.

#### 27. What is SafeEntry?

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FINs and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

More information can be found at <https://www.safeentry.gov.sg>.

### **Returning to Malaysia**

#### 28. Do I need to be tested again in Singapore before I return to Malaysia? Do I need to be quarantined or be tested again upon return to Malaysia?

RGL returnees to Malaysia currently do not need to be tested again in Singapore before returning to Malaysia.

Upon their arrival back in Malaysia, they must adhere to the prevailing COVID-19 prevention and control measures of the Malaysian government. As the specific requirements may change over time, the returnee should verify the latest requirements with the relevant Malaysian authorities.

##### 2. What is the latest I have to be at the clinic, based on my departure flight timing?

You should make an appointment that fits your required testing window, and be present at the clinic early for the appointment.

<u>You must be present at least 2 hours prior to, and no later than, the stipulated cut-off timing in the table below.</u> Travellers who do not adhere to this cut-off timing will not be able to obtain the results in time for departure.

| Flight departure time | Latest Cut-off Test Timing |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 12:00am to 9:29am | 10.00am two calendar days before flight |
| 9:30am to 3:29pm | 4:00pm two calendar days before flight |
| 3.30pm to 11.59pm | 10:00am the day before flight |

*Example:*
*If a traveller’s departure flight time is 12pm on 20 August and the required test must be done within 72 hours of departure, the traveller should take the swab from 12pm on 17 August onwards, until the cut-off timing.*

*The latest the traveller can present himself/herself is by 4pm on 18 August.*

##### 3. How can I make an appointment for pre-departure PCR testing?

For Malaysia, the pre-departure test must be done within 72 hours prior to departure.

Please call the clinic and book your test slot before the Cut-Off Test Timing in the schedule above. This is to ensure that you will have sufficient time to meet the RGL requirements.

##### 4. How far in advance should I make an appointment for the pre-departure PCR test?

Due to limited slots, please make your appointment with the clinic **as early as possible**, once your flight timing and RGL requirements are confirmed.

Please refer to the **Schedule for the “Latest Cut-off Test Timing” and book your test slot within the indicated timing**. This is to ensure that you meet the RGL requirements.

If you do not make a prior appointment, please note that:
1. There is no guarantee that there will be a test slot for you; and
2. You may not get your results in time for your flight to qualify for RGL arrangements. Travellers who miss the cut-off test timing will <u>not</u> be able to obtain a test result in time for their flight.

##### 5. What details will I need to book an appointment for the PCR test?

Please have the following information on hand when making an appointment for your test:
1. Identification or passport numbers
2. Departure flight timing
3. Possible times for your test slot: Please refer to the Test Schedule to confirm your timing. 
4. Address in Singapore
5. Contact number
6. Email address

##### 6. What documents should I bring for my appointment?

Please bring the following:
1. Identity card or passport
2. PDF copy of the Malaysia-issued travel pass which confirms that you are granted approval by the relevant authorities to travel to Malaysia under the Singapore-Malaysia RGL
3. Softcopy showing your departure flight timing

##### Testing

##### 7. What if I miss my test timing? What if I take my test after the Cut-off Test Timing?

Travellers who miss the Cut-off Test Timing will <u>not</u> be able to obtain a test result in time for their scheduled departure.

Please make arrangements early for your test slot so that you can qualify for the RGL.

##### 8. What happens if the clinic assesses that I am unable to receive the PCR test for unforeseen circumstances?

If you are unable to receive the test, you may wish to reschedule your departure, if you still wish to tap on the RGL.

##### Test Results

##### 9. When can I expect to get my PCR test results?

You will receive your PCR test results and memo at least three hours before your scheduled departure.

The clinic will email the results to your email address. You will need to print and bring the memo overseas yourself.
