### **Application**

#### 1.	Who is eligible to apply for the Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) to commute to Singapore?

A sponsoring company may submit a PCA application on behalf of the employee(s) at this PCA application portal if the employee:
- Is a Malaysia Citizen/Permanent Resident/Long-Term Pass holder*;   
- Holds valid long-term visas for business and work purposes in Singapore; and 
- Agrees to spend at least three consecutive months in Singapore.

The application can be submitted at ([insert application link]).

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">* <em>Long-Term Pass holders who are eligible to apply for PCA are holders of the following MOM-issued work passes: (i) Employment Pass; (ii) EntrePass; (iii) Personalised Employment Pass; (iv) S Pass; and (v) Work Permit.</em></p>

#### 2. Can I apply for a PCA pass for my employee to enter Malaysia on this application platform?

No. This PCA application platform is only for sponsoring companies who are applying for a PCA pass on behalf of eligible Malaysia Citizens / Permanent Residents / Long-Term Pass holders to enter Singapore.

If you are applying for the PCA on behalf of your employee to enter Malaysia, you may submit your application at Malaysia’s PCA application page ([insert application link]).

#### 3. How does an eligible Malaysia Citizen / Permanent Resident / Long-Term Pass holder apply to travel to Singapore under PCA? What are the steps from the time an application is put in to the time the result of the PCA application is received? How long is the processing time? What information/documents need to be submitted for the PCA application?

The sponsoring company of eligible Malaysia Citizens / Permanent Residents / Long-Term Pass holders can apply directly on behalf of their employees using a valid CorpPass on Singapore’s PCA application page ([insert application link]). The application for PCA will be open for the next 90 days from the first available date of entry.

When the PCA application is approved, an approval email with a unique PCA Pass will be issued to the traveller and the sponsoring company by email within [3 calendar] days.

The approved traveller is required to present a valid PCA Pass for the intended date of arrival, a valid passport and work pass to enter Singapore, and a proof of payment for PCR swab test at immigration checks when entering Singapore. Otherwise, he/she may be rejected entry.

#### 4. What is a PCA Pass?

A PCA Pass is a [physical/]digital document that verifies the approved PCA application of the holder and allows the holder to seek entry into Singapore under PCA. The PCA pass will indicate the full name of the holder (as in passport), Passport no. and assigned date of entry.  It will only be valid for the first entry into Singapore, i.e. when the holder first enters Singapore on the assigned date of entry (0000hrs to 2359 hrs) after a successful PCA application.*

A daily quota of 2,000 approved travellers are currently permitted to enter Singapore (as of [23 July 2020]). PCA Passes are issued on a limited basis in order to maintain public health controls and resources.

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">* <em>The PCA Pass holder may only travel back to Malaysia for his/her short-term home leave after staying for at least three consecutive months of work in Singapore. After travelling back to Malaysia for his/her short-term home leave, the holder will have to submit a fresh application for re-entry into Singapore.</em></p>

#### 5. Is the PCA Pass of my employee transferrable?

PCA Passes are tagged to the individual, and thus not transferrable to others.

Should another employee require a PCA pass, you may make a separate application on his/her behalf under PCA.

#### 6. Can the family member of my employee who holds a Dependent Pass enter Singapore with my employee if my employee receives an approved PCA application?

No. The PCA does not apply to dependents of Work Pass holders in Singapore.

#### 7. Do I need to pay to apply for PCA on behalf of my employees?

No payment is required for the PCA application. [No fees are levied on the issuance of the PCA Pass.]

#### 8. What is the duration of stay in Singapore that my employee will be eligible for under PCA?

There is no limit to the duration of stay in Singapore for the approved PCA traveller, subject to the validity of his/her long-term visa for business and work purposes.

However, a successful applicant will only be able to apply for another PCA pass to re-enter Singapore three months after the date of prior entry.

#### 9. Can my employee use the PCA to come to Singapore for study, short-term work, or leisure purposes?

No. PCA Passes are only issued to travellers holding valid long-term work pass in Singapore for business and work purposes.

Travellers seeking to enter Singapore for study may wish to visit <https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/entry-approval-required-for-all-long-term-pass-holders> for more information.

#### 10. Am I allowed to change the date of entry indicated in my employee’s approved PCA pass?

No. The approved traveller is expected to enter Singapore on the date of entry indicated in his/her approved PCA pass. Your date of entry has been assigned based on your indicated preference during application, and the daily quota of 2,000 PCA travelers.
