The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a scheme agreed between Singapore and Malaysia to allow work and business-related travel between the two countries via the land border crossings at the Johor-Singapore Causeway and Malaysia-Singapore Second Link. Under the PCA, Malaysia Citizens and Permanent Residents (PRs) with valid Singapore work passes should remain in Singapore for at least 90 days before returning to Malaysia for home leave. Travellers under this scheme are required to serve a Stay-Home-Notice (SHN) of at least 7 days and undertake a COVID-19 PCR swab test.<sup>1</sup>

Singapore-based companies that wish to apply for the PCA for their employees may submit their applications from 10 August 2020, 1200 hours onwards via <<weblink>>.

## **Process Overview**

### **Application Process**

The PCA application has to be submitted by the employer on behalf of their employees, via CorpPass, on <<weblink>> from 10 August 2020, 1200 hours onwards. Employers may choose a date of entry within a 60-day window of their application. All applications will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis. Employers must submit their applications at least 7 days before their employees’ entry into Singapore.

Employers are advised to have the following information of each employee on hand, before proceeding to submit an application:
1. Employee’s FIN;
2. Expiry Date of Employee’s Work Pass;

4. Address of Employee’s Accommodation to complete his/her Stay Home Notice (SHN)<sup>2</sup>; and

Applications will only be processed after payment for the COVID-19 PCR swab test has been made. Payment must be made via credit card. An email alert will be sent to the employer through the contact provided if the PCA application for their employee is successful. The employer will also be informed of the details for their employee’s COVID-19 PCR swab test.

### **Pre-departure from Malaysia**

#### Prior to Arrival

Prior to arrival at the immigration checkpoints, employees approved under the PCA are required to:
- Monitor their health status and do not travel to Singapore if feeling unwell;
- Ensure that they enter Singapore on their approved date as stated in their application and PCA approval email;
- Ensure that they complete the electronic Health Declaration Card (eHDC) at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard>;
- Ensure that they download the TraceTogether, Homer and WhatsApp mobile applications on their mobile phone; and
- Bring along his/her passport and work pass when entering Singapore.

Employees approved under the PCA can commute from Malaysia’s immigration checkpoint to Singapore via personal transport, via private buses that only ferry Malaysian passengers who will be serving SHN, or by foot. Do note that all prevailing Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) fees will apply throughout the period of stay in Singapore for personal transport modes.
