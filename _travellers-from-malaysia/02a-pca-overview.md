## **PERIODIC COMMUTING ARRANGEMENT (PCA)**

The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a scheme agreed between Singapore and Malaysia to allow work and business-related travel between the two countries via the land border crossings at the Johor-Singapore Causeway and Malaysia-Singapore Second Link. Under the PCA, Malaysia Citizens and Permanent Residents (PRs) with valid Singapore work passes should remain in Singapore for at least 90 days before returning to Malaysia for home leave. Travellers under this scheme are required to serve a Stay-Home-Notice (SHN) of at least 7 days and undertake a COVID-19 PCR swab test.<sup>1</sup>
