### **General**

#### 1. What is the Periodic Commuting Arrangement?

The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a scheme agreed between Singapore and Malaysia to allow work and business-related travel between the two countries via the land border crossings at the Johor-Singapore Causeway and Malaysia-Singapore Second Link. Under the PCA, Malaysia Citizens/ Permanent Residents, who are Singapore work pass holders, are permitted to enter Singapore and should reside in Singapore for at least 90 days.

#### 2. What is the rationale for imposing a daily quota?  Is there a webpage for me to check if the daily quota has been maximised?  Are there any plans to revise the daily quota in the future?

The quota is imposed to stagger and manage the volume of daily entrants via our land crossings. This mitigates the extent of crowds and congestion. It also allows swab operations to be conducted more smoothly, without overwhelming our public health system. While companies applying for the PCA are unable to check for the available quota, they will be alerted during registration if the quota has been maximised. Depending on the demand for PCA, the quota may be revised in future.

#### 3. Who should I contact should I have any feedback or queries?

You may wish to contact us via email at <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg>.

### **Application**

#### 4. Can I apply for the PCA for my employee to enter Malaysia on this application platform?

No. This PCA application platform is intended for Singapore-based companies who require their Malaysia employees to return to Singapore for work.

For entry into Malaysia for work, you may submit an application at Malaysia’s PCA application page [insert application link](https://www.google.com) instead.

#### 5. How does an eligible Malaysia Citizen/Permanent Resident apply to travel to Singapore under the PCA? What are the steps from the time an application is put in, to the time the result of the PCA application is received? How long is the processing time? What information/documents need to be submitted for the PCA application?

Individuals are not permitted to apply for PCA. Singapore-based companies have to apply for the PCA on behalf of their employees to enter Singapore for work. The company has to submit the PCA application using their CorpPass at [<<weblink>>](https://www.google.com). Applications for the PCA can be made up to 60 days prior to the intended date of entry. Details on the type of information employers are to submit can be accessed [<<here>>](https://www.google.com).

Upon successful application under the PCA, an email will be sent to the point of contact provided by the company in the application.

#### 6. Is the PCA approval of my employee transferrable?

No. Approvals are given to a specific employee and therefore cannot be transferred.

Should another employee require to enter Singapore under PCA, a separate application must be submitted.

#### 7. Can the family member of my employee who holds a Dependant Pass/Long-Term Visit Pass enter Singapore with my employee, if my employee receives an approved PCA application?

The PCA is intended to facilitate business/work-related travels, and therefore would not cover individuals who are dependants. Dependants may apply for entry via Ministry of Manpower at this page <https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-to-bring-pass-holders-into-singapore>.

#### 8. Do I need to pay to apply for PCA on behalf of my employees?

Payment (via credit card) for the mandatory COVID-19 PCR swab test for each employee is required upfront at the point of application. Employers should expect to pay up to S$200 (inclusive of GST) per employee for the COVID-19 PCR swab test.

#### 9. What is the duration of stay in Singapore that my employee will be eligible for under PCA?  Can I extend the PCA period for my employee?

There is no limit to the duration of stay in Singapore, subject to the validity of the employee’s long-term work pass for business and work.

Should the employee leave Singapore, employers will only be able to apply for a new PCA for their employee to re-enter Singapore 90 days after the date of his/her prior entry.

#### 10. Can my employee use the PCA to come to Singapore for study, short-term work, or leisure purposes?

No. The PCA application is only for travellers holding a valid long-term work pass in Singapore for business and work purposes.

#### 15. What documentation does my employee who has been approved to enter Singapore under the PCA need to present to the immigration staff in Singapore before he/she will be allowed entry?

### **SHN Measures**

Yes. Co-horting is allowed (up to four pax) if the four employees arrive in Singapore on the same day and under the same PCA application.

### **Health Measures**

#### 18. Are there any materials I can disseminate to my employees to prepare them for their SHN and COVID-19 test in Singapore?

### **Testing Arrangements**

#### 19. My employee is unable to go for his/her COVID-19 test on the scheduled date. Who can I contact to reschedule a new swab appointment?

Employees are expected to strictly adhere to his/her appointment timing for their COVID-19 PCR swab test. It will be a breach of the Infectious Disease Act if he/she does not undergo the COVID-19 PCR swab test. Please note that the employee can only exit his/her SHN if the test result is negative.

#### 20. What COVID-19 tests will my employee be subject to upon arrival in Singapore? How will I and/or my employee be informed of his/her COVID-19 test result?

Employees under the PCA are required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR swab test on the assigned date of swabbing before the end of his/her SHN period. The point of contact provided by the employer will receive an email and SMS message indicating their employees’ test date and designated test site for the PCR swab test.

The employer will be informed of the employee’s COVID-19 PCR swab test result.

In the event that the employee’s result is inconclusive, he/she will be required to take another COVID-19 PCR swab test. The employer will be informed of their employee’s new test date and designated test site via an email.

#### 21. Can my employee take public transport to travel from the declared SHN accommodation to the designated test site for his/her PCR swab test?

No. The employee should not take public transport (buses and trains) for any purpose during their SHN period, including travelling to/from his/her SHN place of residence and the designated test site for his/her COVID-19 test.

The employee may <u>only</u> take the following modes of transport:
1. Personal transport
2. Private buses that only ferry Malaysian passengers who are serving SHN
3. Taxis and private-hire cars hired from dedicated taxi hotlines or ride-hail applications with a clear indication provided on his/her SHN status.

The employee is also required to travel <u>directly</u> from the declared SHN place of residence to the designated test site, and back to the declared SHN place of residence from the test site, without stopping at any other destination along the journey.

#### 22. Can my employee hail a taxi from the street while travelling in Singapore during the SHN period?

No. The employee should only use dedicated taxi hotlines (provided below) or ride-hail applications to hire the taxis or private hire cars. These platforms allow the individual to clearly indicate that he/she is serving SHN, thereby allowing the driver to undertake necessary precautions, including winding down the windows during the trip for greater airflow.
