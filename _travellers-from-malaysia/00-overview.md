The Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) and Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) schemes are meant to address the needs of different groups of cross-border travellers between Malaysia and Singapore.

The RGL enables short-term cross-border travel for essential business and official purposes between both countries, up to a maximum of 14 days' stay. Travellers under the RGL scheme are expected to undergo pre-departure and post-arrival COVID-19 PCR tests, abide by a pre-declared controlled itinerary during their visit, and download and use TraceTogether for their entire period of stay.

The PCA allows Singapore and Malaysia residents, who hold valid work passes in the other country, to enter that country for work. Travellers to Singapore under the PCA scheme are expected to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and undergo a COVID-19 PCR test before the SHN period ends. After at least 90 days in their country of work, they may return to their home country for short-term home leave, and thereafter may re-enter their country of work to continue work for at least another 90 days.
