### **Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) - For Singapore Citizens and  Permanent Residents applying to enter Malaysia**

The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a scheme agreed between Singapore and Malaysia to allow work and business-related travel between the two countries via the land border crossings at the Johor-Singapore Causeway and Malaysia-Singapore Second Link. Under the PCA, Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents (PRs) with valid Malaysia work passes should remain in Malaysia for at least 90 days before returning to Singapore for home leave. The entry and exit between Singapore and Malaysia must be via Woodlands Checkpoint or Tuas Checkpoint in Singapore.

For details on the application procedures and requirements for Singapore Citizens and PRs to enter Malaysia under the PCA, please visit the Immigration Department of Malaysia's website [here](https://www.imi.gov.my/portal2017/index.php/ms/sumber-dan-arkib/pengumuman/1833-malaysia-singapore-border-crossing-arrangement.html). For queries related to entering Malaysia under the PCA, please approach the Immigration Department of Malaysia.

For Malaysian citizens and Malaysia n PRs residing in Singapore who wish to return to Malaysia, your entry into Malaysia is governed by the Malaysian authorities. You may wish to contact the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs ([www.kln.gov.my](https://www.kln.gov.my)), the Malaysian Immigration Department ([www.imi.gov.my](https://www.imi.gov.my)) or the Malaysian High Commission in Singapore (<https://www.kln.gov.my/web/sgp_singapore>) for further advice.

### **Waiver of Stay-Home Notice when returning to Singapore on Short-Term Home Leave**

Singapore Citizens and PRs holding Malaysia-issued PCA passes (MyTravelPass) may apply for waiver of Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for short-term home leave in Singapore, after spending at least 90 days working in Malaysia. The intent of the Malaysia-issued PCA passes is to allow Singapore Citizens and PRs to re-enter Malaysia after their home leave, to continue with their business or work. In lieu of SHN, the returnee on home leave will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at Woodlands Checkpoint or Tuas Checkpoint in Singapore, at their own cost.

Applications for waiver of SHN will be open from 10 August 2020 and must be submitted online via the SafeTravel Portal (<https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg>) at least 7 days before the entry date. The applicant is required to upload a PDF copy of the Malaysia-issued PCA pass or approval to apply for the waiver of SHN and make payment for a swab-on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test at the land checkpoints (S$200 per person, inclusive of GST). Upon successful application of the waiver, an approval letter will be sent via email to the traveller, stating the Terms & Conditions for the waiver, which the traveller must comply with. These include: (i) adhere to the date, time and land checkpoint which he/she has selected for return to Singapore, (ii) undergo the COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival, and (iii) self-isolation at the declared place of residence upon entry into Singapore, until a negative test result is conveyed to the traveller.

Singapore Citizens and PRs holding Malaysia-issued PCA passes who do not apply for a SHN waiver will be subject to the prevailing public health measures for incoming travellers. Please refer to MOH’s website for information on the prevailing health measures for Singapore Citizens and PRs returning from abroad.

### **Eligibility**

Singapore Citizens and PRs who wish to apply for a waiver of SHN when returning to Singapore on short-term home leave must fulfil the following criteria:
1. Be a Singapore Citizen / PR;
2. Be working in Malaysia under the PCA; and

Singapore Citizens and PRs who do not meet the criteria can still return to Singapore under regular arrangements and be subject to Singapore’s prevailing public health measures for incoming travellers. Please refer to MOH’s website for information on the prevailing health measures for Singapore Citizens and PRs returning from abroad.

## **Process Overview**

### **Application Process**

Singapore Citizens and PRs can apply for SHN waiver for their short-term home leave on the SafeTravel Portal (<https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg>) from 10 August 2020, 1200hrs onwards. Travellers must submit the following information during the application:

3. Intended land checkpoint (Woodlands Checkpoint or Tuas Checkpoint) to enter Singapore from, subject to availability of COVID-19 PCR swab services at the respective Checkpoints;
4. Date of expected re-entry to Malaysia;
5. A valid Malaysia-issued PCA pass (MyTravelPass) or approval certifying that the traveller has been or will continue working in Malaysia under the PCA; and
6. An email address for ICA to respond to.

If the application is approved, the applicant is required to make payment online for a swab-on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test at the land checkpoints (S$200 per person, inclusive of GST). Thereafter, an approval letter will be sent via email.

The traveller should bring a copy of the approval letter to Woodlands Checkpoint or Tuas Checkpoint in Singapore on the date of return for home leave, along with the necessary travel documents.

<p style="font-size: 1.0rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">* <em>Singapore Citizens and PRs currently working in Malaysia and do not have a Malaysia-issued PCA pass yet should apply for a PCA pass (MyTravelPass) from the Malaysian authorities, before submitting their application to ICA for SHN waiver. This Malaysia-issued PCA pass or approval would certify that the traveller has confirmed his/her re-entry into Malaysia at a later date, to continue working in Malaysia under the PCA.</em></p>

### **Arrival at Woodlands Checkpoint or Tuas Checkpoint in Singapore**

Travellers should enter Singapore via the land checkpoint stated in their SHN waiver approval letter, and on the scheduled date and time. No refunds will be available for the COVID-19 PCR test if travellers fail to arrive within the approved entry date and checkpoint.

Upon arrival at the land checkpoints, Singapore Citizens and PRs holding Malaysia-issued PCA passes and valid approval for waiver of SHN will undergo passport, customs and security clearance, followed by a COVID-19 PCR test at the land checkpoints. Upon completion of the COVID-19 PCR test, the traveller should proceed directly to his/her declared place of residence, and remain isolated in his/her residence until a negative test result is conveyed to Him/Her. The traveller should not use public transport for travelling from the land checkpoints to the residence, with the exception of taxis/private hire vehicles and personal vehicles. The traveller should use dedicated taxi hotlines or ride-hail applications to hire the taxis and private hire cars, and should not flag down a taxi.

If the traveller tests positive for COVID-19, he/she will be given medical treatment accordingly. The prevailing charging policies for COVID-19 treatment in public healthcare institutions will apply.

Singapore Citizens and PRs holding Malaysia-issued PCA passes who do not apply for a SHN waiver will be subject to the prevailing public health measures for incoming travellers. Please refer to MOH’s website for information on the prevailing health measures for Singapore Citizens and PRs returning from abroad.
