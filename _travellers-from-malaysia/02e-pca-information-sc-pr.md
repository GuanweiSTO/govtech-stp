The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a scheme agreed between Singapore and Malaysia to allow work and business-related travel between each country. Under the PCA, Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents (PRs) with valid Malaysia Work Passes may apply to enter Malaysia under the PCA. The Singapore Citizen and Malaysia Resident will reside in Malaysia for at least 90 days before returning to Singapore for short-term home leave (e.g. two to four weeks). The entry and exit between Singapore and Malaysia must be via Woodlands Checkpoint or Tuas Checkpoint in Singapore.

For Singapore Citizens and PRs who wish to apply to enter Malaysia under the PCA, please refer to [<<weblink to Malaysia’s PCA website>>](https://www.google.com) for details on the application process. To be eligible, applicants must fulfil the following criteria:

### **Waiver of Stay Home Notice when returning to Singapore on short-term home leave**

Singapore Citizens and PRs who have worked in Malaysia under the PCA for at least 90 days may apply for a Stay Home Notice (SHN) waiver when they return to Singapore on short-term home leave (e.g. two to four weeks).
