### **Employerâ€™s Responsibilities for Malaysia Employees under the PCA Scheme**

### **Penalties for Non-compliance**

If you are unable to fulfil the obligations above, you **should not** arrange for your employee to enter Singapore. Employers and employees have a collective duty to ensure that employees comply with the necessary health protocols.

We will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against any party who does not comply with the requirements. Penalties may include work pass revocations, withdrawal of work pass privileges, or criminal proceedings.
