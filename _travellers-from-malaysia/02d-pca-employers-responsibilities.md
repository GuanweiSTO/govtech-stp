 - agrees to disclose, or for the medical provider to disclose, his/her PCR swab test results to the employer and relevant government authorities in Singapore.
- Ensure employees have a SIM card with a Singapore mobile number for MOM to contact them while they are in Singapore.
- Secure a suitable place of residence for employees to complete their 14-day SHN. Their SHN place of residence must fulfil the prevailing SHN advisory and guidelines. Cohorting is only allowed (up to 4 pax) if the employees arrive in Singapore on the same day.
- If employees do not have their personal vehicles, employers should arrange transportation for employees to commute: (i) between Malaysia and Singapore’s checkpoints; and (ii) from Singapore’s checkpoint to their SHN place of residence. Employees are prohibited from taking public transportation to their SHN place of residence.

### **Penalties for Non-compliance**

If you are unable to fulfil the obligations above, you **should not** arrange for your employee to enter Singapore. Employers and employees have a collective duty to ensure that employees comply with the necessary health protocols.

We will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against any party who does not comply with the requirements. Penalties may include work pass revocations, withdrawal of work pass privileges, or criminal proceedings.
