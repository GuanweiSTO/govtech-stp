### **Employer’s Responsibilities for Malaysia Employees under the PCA Scheme**

#### Before your employees leave for Singapore

- Prior to submitting the entry application on behalf of the employee, the employer must obtain an acknowledgement from the employee that he/she:
  - has read and understood the following terms and conditions; and
  - agrees to disclose, or for the medical provider to disclose, his/her PCR swab test results to the employer and relevant government authorities in Singapore.
- Ensure employees have a SIM card with a Singapore mobile number for MOM to contact them while they are in Singapore.
- Secure a suitable place of residence for employees to complete their 14-day SHN. Their SHN place of residence must fulfil the prevailing SHN advisory and guidelines. Cohorting is only allowed (up to 4 pax) if the employees arrive in Singapore on the same day.
- If employees do not have their personal vehicles, employers should arrange transportation for employees to commute: (i) between Malaysia and Singapore’s checkpoints; and (ii) from Singapore’s checkpoint to their SHN place of residence. Employees are prohibited from taking public transportation to their SHN place of residence.

#### After your employees arrive in Singapore

- Ensure employees fully understand and comply with the conditions imposed for the SHN period. Employees should:
  - Not leave their SHN premises throughout the whole SHN period.
  - Carry their mobile phones with internet connection at all times. They must respond to MOM’s phone calls, video calls, or SMSes within one hour.
  - Not have any visitors and minimise contact with others.
  - Maintain a record of persons they come into close contact with.
  - Act responsibly based on advisories issued by the Singapore Government.
  - Take a PCR swab test before the end of their SHN. Employees must be tested negative before they can be released from their SHN.
- Ensure employees go for their PCR swab test at the slot assigned to them. If employees do not have their own personal vehicles, please arrange for transportation from their SHN place of residence to the testing facility, and immediately back to their SHN place of residence after their PCR swab test. Employees are prohibited from taking public transportation.
- Employers and/or employees should bear all medical costs, including the PCR swab test, incurred for the employees’ entry into Singapore.
- Arrange to provide employees with food and other daily essentials during their SHN via contactless delivery.

### **Penalties for Non-compliance**

If you are unable to fulfil the obligations above, you **should not** arrange for your employee to enter Singapore. Employers and employees have a collective duty to ensure that employees comply with the necessary health protocols.

We will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against any party who does not comply with the requirements. Penalties may include work pass revocations, withdrawal of work pass privileges, or criminal proceedings.
