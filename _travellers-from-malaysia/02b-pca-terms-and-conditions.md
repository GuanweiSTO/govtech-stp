### **Employer’s Responsibilities for Malaysia Employees under the PCA Scheme**

#### Before your employees leave for Singapore

What you need to do:

1. Prior to submitting the entry application on behalf of the employee, the employer must obtain an acknowledgement from the employee that he/she:
: a. has read and understood the following terms and conditions; and
: b. agrees to disclose, or for the medical provider to disclose, his/her COVID-19 PCR test results to the employer and relevant government authorities in Singapore.
2. Ensure that the employee has a work pass that is valid for at least 15 days from their date of entry into Singapore.
3. Ensure that the employee downloads the *TraceTogether, Homer,* and *WhatsApp* mobile applications upon entry into Singapore.
4. Secure a suitable place of residence for the employee to complete their SHN. His/her place of residence for SHN declared in the PCA application for the employee must fulfil the prevailing SHN advisory and guidelines. Cohorting is allowed <u>up to 4 pax</u>, provided that the employees arrive in Singapore on the same day.
5. If employee does not drive/ride their personal vehicles into Singapore, the employer should arrange transportation for employees to commute directly: (i) between Malaysia and Singapore’s checkpoints; and (ii) from Singapore’s checkpoint to their declared place of residence for SHN. The employee is prohibited from taking public trains and buses to his/her declared place of residence for SHN.

#### After your employees arrive in Singapore

1. Ensure the employee has a SIM card with a Singapore mobile number for MOM to SMS and conduct voice/video calls via *WhatsApp* while he/she is in Singapore.
2. Ensure the employee fully understand and complies with the conditions imposed for the SHN period (at least 7 days). The employee should:
: a. Not leave his/her declared place of residence for SHN throughout the whole SHN period.
: b. Act on MOM’s SMS, which will be sent within 1 to 3 days of his/her arrival, asking Him/Her to download and register their mobile number on the Homer mobile application. The employee must have a thermometer to take and report his/her temperature 3 times a day using the Homer mobile application.
: c. Carry his/her mobile phones with data connectivity at all times. He/she must respond to MOM’s phone calls, video calls, or SMSes within one hour.
: d. Not have any visitors and minimise contact with others.
: e. Maintain a record of persons he/she comes into close contact with.
: f. Act responsibly based on advisories issued by the Singapore Government.
: g. Take a COVID-19 PCR test before the end of his/her SHN. The employee must be tested negative before they can be released from their SHN.
3. Ensure the employee goes for their COVID-19 PCR test at the slot assigned to Him/Her. If the employee does not have his/her own personal vehicles, please arrange for transportation (company transportation or taxis/private-hire cars booked via dedicated hotlines or ride-hail applications) from their declared place of residence for SHN to the testing facility, and immediately back to their declared place of residence for SHN after their swab. The employee should not take public buses and trains or flag down a taxi. 
4. Arrange to provide the employee with food and other daily essentials during his/her SHN via contactless delivery.
5. Arrange for non-emergency medical needs so that the employee need not leave the place of residence during the SHN.

### **Penalties for Non-Compliance**

You **should not** arrange for your employees to enter Singapore if you are unable to fulfil the obligations above. Employers and employees have a collective duty to ensure the employees comply with the necessary health protocols.

We will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against any party who does not comply with the above requirements. Penalties may include work pass revocations and withdrawal of work pass privileges.
