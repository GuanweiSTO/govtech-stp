On 11 September 2020, Singapore and Japan agreed to implement the Reciprocal Green Lane (Business Track) to facilitate essential short-term business and official travel between both countries. 

The Singapore-Japan RGL is applicable to all residents in Singapore and Japan entering/exiting through Tokyo (Narita International Airport or Haneda International Airport) or Osaka (Kansai International Airport).

The SafeTravel Pass is a mandatory document for in-bound travellers seeking to make essential business and official travel from Japan to Singapore under the Singapore-Japan RGL.
