On 11 September 2020, Singapore and Japan agreed to implement the Reciprocal Green Lane (Business Track) to facilitate essential short-term business and official travel between both countries. 

The Singapore-Japan RGL is applicable to all residents in Singapore and Japan entering/exiting through Tokyo (Narita International Airport or Haneda International Airport) or Osaka (Kansai International Airport).

The SafeTravel Pass is a mandatory document for in-bound travellers seeking to make essential business and official travel from Japan to Singapore under the Singapore-Japan RGL.

### **Application**

Business or official travellers seeking to travel via the RGL to Singapore must be sponsored<sup>1</sup> by either a Singapore-based company or a Singapore Government agency, which will file an application on behalf of the applicant for a SafeTravel Pass

IMPORTANT

- Travellers (who are not Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents or Long-Term Pass holders) without a valid SafeTravel Pass will be refused entry into Singapore.
For more information on the Terms and Conditions of the SafeTravel Pass, please [click here](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/japan/rgl/terms-and-conditions).

## **Process Overview**

### **Before entering Singapore**

#### Visa Requirements

When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the sponsoring company or government agency.  

With the SafeTravel Pass approval, an approved applicant who is a visa-required passport holder can proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels.  If the applicant already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa.  The applicant can check his/her visa status through [this page](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save). 

**Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for Green/Fast Lane travel.**  Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/entryanddeparting/before/entryvisa/> for more information on Singaporeâ€™s visa requirements.  

The approved applicant will have to electronically submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations and declare his/her accommodation in Singapore via the **SG Arrival Card**, before departing for Singapore.  The SG Arrival Card can also be accessed via the **Visit Singapore Travel Guide App**.
